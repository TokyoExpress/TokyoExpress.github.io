		<p>Well, disregard most of everything I said in the last post. Orientation was a real clownfest, with it being mostly composed of boring lectures, white kids, international kids, and a poor class registration system. I met the people that I should have met. I'll do the rest of the work when I get to school and am among a full student body that isn't just full of weirdos.</p>
		<p>Anyways, this one is pretty short because I don't feel like writing that much. I worry a lot about random stuff. I shouldn't. You guys shouldn't either. Just live an anxiety-free life. Easy. Your lives are now changed forever. Enjoy your blissful existence and state of mind as you realize how utterly meaningless some things are.</p>
		<p>Okay. Have fun.</p>
