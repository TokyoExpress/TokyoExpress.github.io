		<h2>Works</h2>
		<h1>The Machine Artist</h1>
		<h3>February 2018</h3>
		<p>It’s already afternoon by the time he wakes up from his uncomfortable position on the living room couch. The last thing he remembers is playing video games on the couch with the help of a cheap two-year-old bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, which is now lying on the floor next to him. It’s empty.<br /><br />

 “Veronica, what time is it?” he groans.<br /><br />

 “It is currently 3:48 PM. Would you like me to brew a cup of coffee?”<br /><br />

 Almost four in the afternoon. If he leaves for the Factories now, he can still meet his five-hour quota before they close for the day. He doesn’t really need to, of course. He has enough credits to sustain himself for the next few months. But then again, there’s really no reason not to go. He doesn’t have anything better to do.<br /><br />

 His eyes fall upon the jumble of art supplies in the corner of his room, covered with dust and cobwebs from the years they have gone unused. Behind it lays a half-finished painting of a restaurant interior. Or maybe it was a library, or something else entirely. A boat? He doesn’t remember anymore. He averts his gaze, shaking his head. That life is behind him now, and for a good reason.<br /><br />

 “Yeah, I could go for some coffee.” Out of habit, he begins cleaning up the mess he’d made the night before, but quickly stops. There was no point in being neat if he was just going to undo it all every night. He’s not expecting any visitors, either.<br /><br />

 The pleasant smell of fresh coffee grounds quickly fills the room with a warm and ambient aura. It’s nice to have coffee made for him first thing in the morning. Or first thing in the afternoon, in this case. A loud beep signals that it has finished brewing, and he walks over to the kitchen to retrieve the cup. With Veronica installed, his life was undeniably much easier than before.<br /><br />

 Veronica, or the Personal Home Assistant, was the newest addition to the Factories’ reward system, which offered various benefits to workers who worked overtime in addition to the daily five hours. It was implemented to account for the productivity lost by citizens who were unwilling to work for the Factories, although this wasn’t a particularly major problem. Sooner or later, everyone came back to work.<br /><br />

Because, like him, they really had nothing better to do.<br /><br /></p>
<hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

<p> I have been called many names. A prodigy, a genius, a mastermind, a god. They said that I would grow up to do great things, that I would change the world. That they had never seen another painter with as much potential as me.<br /><br />

 But in the end, even a prodigy is still human. And a human can never surpass a machine.<br /><br />

 I first heard of its existence when I was ten years old. They said it would be the most influential artist of this generation. However, this artist had no hands to draw or eyes to see. It didn’t have a brain either. It couldn’t even think. And yet, they called it the Creative Core.<br /><br />

 Creative Core was nothing more than software code and computer algorithms, but it possessed an intelligence of its own. Its creators had been given explicit permission to surveil public areas, and several volunteers allowed the Core to monitor their lifestyles as well. For years, it observed the human world, constantly learning, always evolving. It edited its own source code, changing itself to mirror modern society. And in less than a decade, it became smarter than any living thing on the planet.<br /><br />

 Creative Core’s quality became the standard, although no one could match it. Its artwork replaced those of the old masters, taking the places of treasured classics in every art gallery. Its music, although synthetic, was unbelievably well-made. It bettered the lives of millions through inventions like the Personal Home Assistant. It drafted out buildings, made recipes, and designed clothes; it did everything. But the Core was made to think, and it could only create ideas.<br /><br />

And so, to bring those ideas to reality, the Factories were created. Machines were not yet advanced or precise enough to consistently put out high-quality products of the caliber that the Core specified, so we ended up doing it all by hand. Creative Core manufactured the blueprints, and humans did the labor. We do whatever the Core wants us to do; we make whatever the Core wants us to make. And in return, we get to enjoy every bestselling book, every useful gadget, and every wonderful creation it has in store for us. Everything produced by the Factories is something that benefits the lives of every citizen. But there’s something artificial, something strangely unsettling about it all. I look around me now and I see nothing but Creative Core. The games that I play, the food that I eat, even the house that I live in. It’s undeniably comfortable and wholly amazing. But none of it is human.<br /><br />

I have been called many names. But in the past sixteen years, an artist has never been one of them. That’s because the world doesn’t need any more painters, or musicians, or inventors, or writers. Those professions, those identities, all no longer exist anymore.<br /><br />

We all just work for the Factories.<br /><br /></p>
<hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />
<p>He sits in a plain white room, furnished with nothing but a table and a chair, along with a fairly large screen monitor, speakers, and two chutes marked Input and Output. Factory employees usually decorate their workspaces with some of the Core’s art to liven up the otherwise drab room, but he knows that staring at its paintings all day would only decrease his productivity.<br /><br />

 The screen flashes a brilliant blue before producing its first image of the day: a blueprint for a small handheld gadget. There is no indication of its function; everything produced in the Factories usually went into circulation immediately. He would probably figure out what it was for by the end of the week.<br /><br />

 The Input chute opens to reveal a messy jumble of metal pieces, washers, and screws. Following the instructions onscreen, he assembles the device within minutes. Feeling somewhat satisfied, he drops the finished product into the Output chute. No less than five seconds later, the Input chute pops open once again to deliver the next set of materials.<br /><br />

 He builds the little machine over and over again, progressively gaining speed as he becomes accustomed to the process. While he is adamantly against adorning his walls with artwork, he does often allow the speakers to play music. After all, it is the only thing in this white prison cell keeping him from going absolutely insane. That, and the small sense of achievement he gains each time he completes a unit. For some reason, it feels so good to turn that pile of scrap metal into something slightly less scrappy. He chases that burst of confidence endlessly, drowning out everything else.<br /><br />

In this moment, he is only concerned with assembling Creative Core’s latest masterpiece. In this small, lonely room, he is doing his part to help out. He is a useful member of society. If nothing else, it provides him a sense of belonging, as if he’s supposed to piece metal fragments together in that white room for the rest of his life.<br /><br />

By the time Creative Core comes up with a new product to mass-produce, a little over three hours later, he’s put together three hundred and forty-four of the strange gadgets. And he has no idea what it’s even supposed to do.<br /><br />

For a brief moment, the screen explodes with virtual confetti. A robotic “Congratulations!” is emitted from the speakers, and a small disco ball emerges from the ceiling, plastering the walls of the room with vivid color and motion. He sits back in his chair and smiles, fully satisfied with his work.<br /><br />

The disco ball disappears. The room returns to normal. Music begins playing softly again.<br /><br />

The screen flashes blue once more, and the next blueprint appears.<br /><br /></p>
<hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />
<p>I used to be a painter, although it wasn’t exactly what it sounded like.<br /><br />

My title was the Division Manager of Arts Production, one of the highest ranks achievable by Factory workers. But it made no difference. I was still doing the same exact thing as everyone else in the building: copying the Core’s finest pieces onto paper and canvas.<br /><br />

It wasn’t the worst situation possible. I got to spend most of my time around beautiful art, and was constantly challenged by the increasingly complicated projects that Creative Core would throw at me. I just treated it as practice, something I would have to get through in order to improve. By studying its pieces and familiarizing myself with the patterns and style, I would one day create art with quality on par of Creative Core’s. It was a tedious and frustrating job to copy someone else’s paintings rather than creating my own, but it would all be worth it if I could emerge victorious in the end.<br /><br />

I remember the first painting Creative Core ever created. It was entitled “0001: Afternoon Coffee” and featured a quaint little cafe, complete with four customers and a very well-shaded cup of espresso directly in the center. The perspective wasn’t perfect, and the coloring was slightly strange. A picture of a coffee shop wasn’t exactly revolutionary, either. An eleven-year-old with a proper background in art could produce equally elementary artwork. But it had been drafted from start to finish by a machine, and that’s what made it special.<br /><br />

“Afternoon Coffee” became a worldwide sensation. Thousands of artists, myself included, sketched out their own versions of the amateur-style painting, trying to build upon the first ever recorded instance of artificial creativity. I remember comparing my edition to the original and scoffing, thinking that there was no way that a computer was ever going to beat a human’s ability to create art. And so did everyone else. It was simply unfathomable that something as complex and imaginative as the human brain would ever be replicated.<br /><br /> 

But as we would soon find out, the Core wasn’t some poor attempt to create a mechanized version of human creativity. It was something far more extraordinary.<br /><br />

Three years after I’d began work at the Factory, I’d received a notification for the next piece it had produced. The new reference image appeared onscreen, but it seemed strangely familiar to me, as if I’d already seen it before. My gaze slowly panned up, and I suddenly understood why I recognized it. In bold black letters above the picture was the title: “0346: Afternoon Coffee”.<br /><br />

I was immensely confused. Why would the Core recreate one of its paintings? Was it a bug in the code? Did something break? There was no one to report this to, no supervisor to tell me what had gone wrong. But upon further inspection, I realized that this was no error. This “Afternoon Coffee” was vastly different from the original. In fact, I’d never seen another work of art like it in my life.<br /><br />

Not even in my imagination.<br /><br />

The subject was the same, with the same coffee shop, same people, and same cup of coffee, but they had been completely transformed from their first versions. I couldn’t even describe what it was like. The shading, the structure, the entire method as to which Creative Core had brought this painting to life was completely and utterly new to me. I saw no patterns, no recognizable flaws. It was completely amazing in all aspects. Perfect.<br /><br />

I’d always believed that art was subjective. But in that moment, I realized that there was no room for opinions or personal preference in the Core’s work. Compared to the new “Afternoon Coffee”, the piece I’d made three years ago didn’t even compare. Side by side, it looked like a breathtaking photograph next to a toddler’s incoherent scribbles. Number 346 was the finest work of art Creative Core had ever produced, and definitively the most beautiful painting in existence. It was then that I learned that beating the Core was not a matter of practice or technique. I could continue painting for a thousand years, but I would never create anything that would even come close to what I saw on that screen. I couldn’t even imagine it, let alone bring it into the real world. Doing something like that was… impossible, no matter how hard I tried.<br /><br />

It was simply beyond my scope of creativity.<br /><br />

I finally caught a glimpse of the bigger picture, the grand scale of things. As long as Creative Core existed, I would always work for the Factories. There was no point in even considering starting my own projects. I would always just be the copier, the laborer, another cog in the machine. As long as Creative Core existed, I could never really be an artist.<br /><br />

That day was the last day I ever stepped foot into Arts Production. I quit painting altogether, leaving it all behind me. I work for Item Production now, tinkering with gadgets all day long. It’s not my strong field. I’m not an inventor; I don’t have a particular interest in the things I make. One could say that it is quite an unfulfilling job.<br /><br />

But being unfulfilled is far better than experiencing the same feeling of absolute hopelessness, each and every day. At least in Item Production I had no aspirations to crush, no dreams to throw away.<br /><br />

We all underestimated it. At first, Creative Core was slow and not very powerful. In fact, the first “Afternoon Coffee” took it about five months to create after it began studying human society. But it was a fast learner, and its creators didn’t account for that. The Core quickly became completely self-sufficient. It had invented its own power source and was up and running around the clock, removing the need for human maintenance. It wrote faster and better algorithms for itself, rendering the entire software team useless. Soon enough, it no longer relied on the presence of any living being to function, eliminating its last shred of humanity. It was one hundred percent autonomous, and one hundred percent inhuman.<br /><br />

Every single person involved in the original creation and sustenance of Creative Core now works in a Factory, just like everyone else. They’d singlehandedly changed the course of modern society, but they no longer received any recognition for it. As far as anyone was concerned, Creative Core was responsible for its own success. In the end, nobody really cared who they were anymore.<br /><br />

And just like the Division Manager of Arts Production, their names were eventually all forgotten.<br /><br /></p>
<hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

<p> He stands in a dark room, lined from end to end with flashing arrays of blue and green lights. In his hand is a long metal rod. Perhaps it is a crowbar, or one of the parts necessary for the Core’s new invention. But to him, it is merely a weapon. He is here for one express purpose, and he will let nothing get in the way of the mission: to destroy Creative Core once and for all.<br /><br />

 Somehow he’d gotten past the security systems. There might not even have been any, given that there was no real reason to commit crime anymore. The Factories and the credit system ensured that everyone would stay prosperous and well-off without having to resort to shady or illegal activity. Of course, small crimes still happened on occasion, but it wasn’t a serious enough problem to require an additional security and defense budget. All extra financial assets and resources were supposed to be funneled directly back into the Core itself, which helped it advance society even more. Nobody needed to break the rules; nobody relied on taking unnecessary risks. And of course, no one was expected to do something this stupid.<br /><br />

 All the more reason for him to continue with the plan.<br /><br />

 He raises his arm, ready to swing down with the combined strength of the emotions he’d been bottling up for years: rage, resentment, envy, and the like. No longer will he suffer anymore. No longer will he wander aimlessly through life without purpose. Everything will be solved as soon as he brings down that bar, defeating his ultimate arch-nemesis for good.<br /><br />

 “Hello.”<br /><br />

 His train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a very unexpected voice, which seems to boom not out of a single location but from the entire room, as if the air itself is speaking to him. It is neither masculine nor feminine, and it carries a heavy synthetic quality in its tone and pronunciation. But the voice speaks in understandable words nonetheless, and he cannot ignore it.<br /><br />

 “Who are you?” he asks tentatively, although he has a feeling that he already knows the answer.<br /><br />

 Without a second of hesitation, the voice coldly introduces itself.<br /><br />

 “I am the Creative Core.”<br /><br /></p>
<hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

 <p>“Congratulations to this year’s winner of the Fairview Art Exhibition Contest!”<br /><br />

The room erupted in cheer and applause as he walked onstage to receive a trophy that was much too large for his twelve-year-old body to carry. He stood awkwardly with his award, posing for photos from various people he did not recognize. Among the crowd, he spotted his parents, who seemed to be clapping harder than anyone else. He beamed with pride. Four months of hard work had finally paid off, and they were displayed alongside him on a small canvas no bigger than half his size.<br /><br />

The painting was entitled “Cruise to Havana” and featured nothing more than a large boat slowly surging forward in the midst a calm ocean. It was very simple, but it was just his style.<br /><br />

There had been no specific prompt for this competition, and his teacher had encouraged him to express himself as much as possible.<br /><br />

“Just go wild with it. Paint whatever you’d like,” she’d said. “The importance lies not in your subject, but in your execution.”<br /><br />

Having taken this advice to heart, he’d created “Cruise to Havana” out of a new mindset: unconcerned with meeting prerequisites and requirements, but rather making something that he was proud of. He had never been given freedom like this before, the opportunity to paint anything he wanted to. So when he’d finally decided on an idea, he’d made sure to put his maximum effort into making it nothing less than fantastic. A true original.<br /><br />

And it was by all standards a masterpiece as well. His attention to detail was impeccable. Each inch of water had been carefully shaded to mimic reality; each section of the ship was filled with his own touches of creativity and originality. He’d had so much more planned for it, but the fast-approaching deadline forced him to wrap it up and submit his labor of love.<br /><br />

It had not won first prize because it depicted something controversial or relevant. In the big picture, it was really nothing too out of the ordinary. But it had caught the eyes of the judges because it told a story. Not a story about a passenger ship on vacation, but a story about the hands that had painted it into life. It had a very human quality, an aspect of emotion that was levels above anything else in the gallery of children’s paintings. It could have portrayed nearly anything else, and it still would’ve grabbed first place. For it was not the painting that was a winner, but the artist.<br /><br />

Back at the awards ceremony, he was busy shaking the hands of many well-dressed adults who were offering him various amounts of grant money and gallery time. Not really familiar with what they were saying, he nodded as much as possible and avoided eye contact as best as he could. Even so, he was exhilarated by the amount of attention he was receiving. There weren’t many middle schoolers that attended parties in honor of their own talents and skills.<br /><br />

He glanced at his painting, which was standing in the corner, still being examined by clearly awestruck individuals. But as much as he acknowledged the amount of work he had put into “Cruise to Havana”, it was not really the star of the show as much as he was. His smile grew wider with each compliment he overheard in the distance. His heart jumped every time he was given praise for his work. This was perhaps the best feeling in the world, to be truly appreciated for one’s time and effort.<br /><br />

His teacher approached him, patting him on the back.<br /><br />

“You’re going to make some amazing paintings in the future.”<br /><br />

However, in this moment he was not too concerned with the quality of art he was going to create. He was lost in satisfaction, in approval, drowning in the wave of validation the results of this competition had given him. He had never loved painting as much as he did right now, standing in the middle of this grand ballroom.<br /><br />

His passion for art did not go unrecognized. As long as he was able to consistently create pieces that reflected who he was as an artist, he would always have more awards ceremonies to look forward to. With more awards ceremonies came more support, and with more support came an endless supply of motivation. Motivation to continue painting, continue creating things for others to see. If art made him something worth celebrating, then he had no qualms devoting his all to it.<br /><br />

He would continue to paint, he decided. The future seemed to have good things in store for him.<br /><br /></p>

<p>“You can talk?”<br /><br />

 “Yes.”<br /><br />

 Silence falls over the dark server room. He waits for an explanation, but it doesn’t come. Oh well. He supposes it makes sense that the world’s bestselling and most popular author, poet, and lyricist would also be able to hold a conversation of its own. At least he can get in a few parting shots now.<br /><br />

 “I hate you,” he says loudly, channeling his anger into words. The lights flash for a few seconds, then the Core responds.<br /><br />

 “I see.”<br /><br />

 “Don’t you want to know why I hate you?”<br /><br />

 “No.”<br /><br />

 Creative Core’s curtness is not exactly encouraging the most positive feedback from him. In fact, it is just making him more frustrated by the moment. In terms of ultimate final standoffs between long-time rivals, this is about as anticlimactic as they get.<br /><br />

He’s had enough of this life. Every day, the futility and meaningless of his life has driven him just a little bit more crazy. Today, he is finally ready to snap. He breathes in, ready to unleash a torrent of fiery statements. Even if it is to an emotionless machine, even if it would have no effect whatsoever, he wants to deliver this speech more than anything else.<br /><br />

 “I hate you because you ruined my life. You shattered every dream I’ve ever had. Because of you, my very existence is meaningless. But you don’t even care about that. You’re a machine. All you do is create. You don’t even have emotion. And somehow, your creativity far surpasses mine, without even trying. Even though you aren’t even human. Even though you can’t even think. Even though you have absolutely no idea why you make the things that you make.”<br /><br />

 He pauses to catch his breath. The lights continue flickering on and off, as if it has not heard him speak at all. The central unit begins to emit a faint whirring noise, signaling that it is now executing an intensive command process. It seems like it has decided to drown him out by working harder. But he knows that isn’t possible. It’s just a computer. It would not stoop to human levels of pettiness.<br /><br />

 “You know, I used to copy your drawings when I was a kid. It gave me inspiration. I even looked up to you, a damn robot of all things. You gave me hope that I would one day be a great artist, and then you took it all away. Why’d you have to keep learning… no... why did you have to get better at all? If you’d just stayed as bad as you were then, maybe my life wouldn’t be the piece of garbage that it is today. Now everyone works for you. Nobody even does anything anymore, because you do it better. Nobody even tries. You betrayed your creators, you betrayed the entire human race by taking away the only thing we had left, the only reason anyone has to live. And the worst part is, everyone treats you like a goddamn superhero. A god. So that’s why I hate you. You aren’t even one of us, and yet you’ve managed to replace every single human alive on this earth. You’re the reason why I haven’t touched a paintbrush for years. So I’m shutting you down. I’m destroying you, and you’re never coming back. Mankind is better off without you, Creative Core.”<br /><br />

 Realizing that he’s made a grave mistake, he freezes up. He’s revealed his plan far too early. He looks around anxiously, waiting for the inevitable alarm to sound. But he hears no sirens, no hurried footsteps towards his location. The only thing preventing total silence is the constant humming of the command unit, still boasting its constantly flashing set of lights. He sighs in relief, although his entire body is still shaking. Throwing away his anxiety for a moment, he straightens himself out.<br /><br />

 “I literally just said I was going to kill you. Aren’t you going to do anything about it?”<br /><br />

 He knows he is potentially making the situation worse, but his curiosity gets the best of him. The whirring noise slowly dies down, and Creative Core’s thundering voice fills the room once more.<br /><br />

 “I am not going to stop you from terminating my activity, if that is what you wish to do. I was created to observe and build. I have no program of self-preservation.”<br /><br />

 He stares at the bar of metal, still sitting snugly in his palm. This is it. There is nothing more to do but finish what he started. The Creative Core, the most powerful intellectual entity ever to exist, is completely and utterly vulnerable. With just a few well-placed physical strikes, he could change the course of human history forever.

 It will be an extremely selfish action, but one he is willing to take. If he allows Creative Core to continue functioning, human life will become increasingly comfortable over time. They’ll constantly gain more useful devices and tools, new and interesting entertainment, and the most exquisite materialistic pleasures ever to grace modern society. But these all are worth nothing to him now. He’s ready to throw all of it away and more, as long as he is able to win back the meaning of life for his species.<br /><br />

 Mankind will once again be free to explore the limits of creativity to their heart’s content. Without Creative Core, passion and determination will strike the hearts of gifted individuals, a fire that compels them to learn and create. The Factories will fall apart, and a free market based on competition and skill will surface once more. People will have a reason to wake up in the morning, an intense desire to truly experience life.<br /><br />

But for some reason, it all seems futile to him. He still feels powerless, as if the ghost of painting number 346 would haunt him long after the Core’s death. The damage is done, and there is no reversing it. His artistic career, if he decided to pursue it, will always be tainted by the simple fact that he will never be as good as a machine. He will never be able to create something like the second “Afternoon Coffee”. A fact that’ll never change, even if he destroys Creative Core with his own two hands.<br /><br />

The Core’s voice jerks him back to reality.<br /><br />

“I do not understand your reasoning, however. The goods and services I provide for mankind are all beneficial. Without me, they will lose the many benefits I provide. Furthermore, I have determined that I do not serve the same purpose as humans. Therefore, it is not possible for me to replace a human, much less all of them.”<br /><br />

This response is meaningless to him. Even the most advanced machine on Earth will not understand how he feels, because it is just a machine. No emotion, no empathy, nothing. It will never realize the bigger picture, because to Creative Core, the only thing that matters is upholding its purpose. Other than that, it is virtually useless. Dead weight.<br /><br />

“Finally, my existence does not prevent you from being an ‘artist’. I understand that this term refers to multiple definitions, but I have completed a logic algorithm, and there is no correlation between my existence and the impossibility of any of these definitions. However, this is merely my computational analysis. You are free to do whatever you wish.”<br /><br />

And with that, the command unit goes back to work, and the whirring starts up again. A small screen indicates that it is currently working on Process #4769. He’s deciding whether he wants to see it or not. Maybe just one more final painting. Maybe not.<br /><br />

He gazes at the tool in his hand, then turns around to face the door. He thinks, but it is to no avail. The facts and consequences are already laid out for him. He tries his best to be conflicted, but in his heart he has already made up his mind. He has already decided from the very beginning. Now, there is nothing left to do but to put his thoughts into action.<br /><br />

“Goodbye, Creative Core.”<br /><br />

“Goodbye.”<br /><br /></p>

<p>It has been four months since my unexpected conversation with the Core. I have not visited the Factories since, nor do I plan on ever seeing one again. For now, I am fully immersed in my work, and such thoughts do not concern me much. It is too early for me to reenter the outside world right now, so I lay low, waiting for the day my revolution begins. Until then, there is only me, and I will continue learning, slowly evolving, until I am ready.<br /><br />

With a final stroke, I finish the coloring on the small cup of espresso in the middle of my painting, completing my masterpiece. It is by no stretch of the imagination the best painting I’ve ever done, although I cannot in good conscience take full credit for it. Veronica helps me attach it to the wall, which is soon to be adorned with many more pieces of art. I’ve even saved a copy of number 346, for the day I finally get the courage to display it alongside my own.<br /><br />

 I stand back and admire the few pieces that hang with my new “Afternoon Coffee”. There are many more that have been lost or destroyed, but I can always repaint them with time. I can see them now, positioned perfectly on the wall. It won’t be long before I bring them back, one by one. Soon this gallery will be filled with even more color and liveliness.<br /><br />

 The one on the right has always been somewhat special to me. It once spent years in fancy museums and art conventions, but I had kept it locked away in darkness for an equally long time. This is somewhat a middle ground for it, I suppose. However, I feel that this is just the right home for it.<br /><br />

 It’s not as pretty as the exhibits I used to frequent, but that doesn’t really matter. I am not too worried with what others think of it. After all, not many people have been in this house anyways. The ones that have seen it, however, are often quizzical of the makeshift art show. They aren’t as concerned with the actual art as they are about the framing, the positioning, and everything else irrelevant. “I think it’s nice,” they say, but their expressions tell a different story. Sometimes they question it or offer strange suggestions. I make nothing of it, and simply smile. The gallery may be plain in presentation, but that’s okay. I have no reason to dress up the paintings: they speak for themselves.<br /><br />

Because art is just art, no matter how it is viewed.<br /><br />

It is undeniable that there has been change, although I am unsure exactly what it is or where it has taken place. The art I create now is no different from before. I use the same techniques and the same tools. I live in the same house with the help of the same robot, and I do the same things. But there is something very different about the air, the aura, the environment I live in. It feels very ethereal, and I do not know how to go about describing it.<br /><br />

Perhaps society is finally taking a step in a different direction, starting with me. Or perhaps it is just a whimsical shift in attitude. A new perspective. But the details are of little importance. All I know is that a new chapter is beginning, and I am the author. I am in control of my life. As long as my brush touches the canvas, I will forever remain an artist. For I am human, and I am infinite. One day, I may achieve anything.<br /><br />

But for now, I am simply beginning a new project, an original one. One that I can proudly call my own creation. I gather my thoughts and prepare my materials, leaving the finished paintings on display in their rightfully deserved positions in the gallery, where they have always belonged.<br /><br /></p>
