		<h1>Greed and the Inevitable End</h1>
		<h3>2:33 PM</h3>
		<p>Today I made around $1,200 off of a call option. I know that’s not particularly much in the world of investment compared to most portfolios, but it’s always nice to have money. I love options because of their intersection with time series and random processes, but whenever I own one, I swear I’m just stressing about it for every second between 6 AM and 1 PM. That’s a long time to just sit there and watch a number go up and down. And sure, it was not bad to get a free grand, but I was a little peeved: had I sold the option about 10 minutes earlier than I did, it would’ve been a little over $2,100 in profit instead.<br /><br />

Maybe you understand, or maybe you’re wondering why I would be so ungrateful, having received a nice blessing in the first place. It’s just $900, and it’s not like there’s any way I could’ve known that that was the optimal time to make the trade. I can see both sides, but it’s revealed to me a particularly insidious trait that we all seem to have in one way or another.<br /><br />

I’ve never thought of myself as greedy or selfish, but I’d be lying if I said that that $900 didn’t make me frustrated. “Why bother? Don’t waste your energy thinking about what could’ve happened,” I would tell myself, had it been someone else. I think about a motto I often used to remind myself of: <i>It’s just money</i>.<br /><br />

I know that it requires a great deal of privilege and good fortune to be able to say that phrase. “Money doesn’t buy happiness,” someone would say, and you could almost expect a couple people to pipe up about how unhappy one would be if he/she was out on the streets starving and couldn’t afford clothes, or something. And yeah, I get it. Financial stability does provide a base level of comfort that alleviates suffering. But I don’t know if that completely negates that age-old adage. Once you reach a point where you’re not struggling to make ends meet and you have food on the table and a roof over your head, suddenly the money doesn’t really do it for you anymore. Happiness becomes something ethereal and abstract, and you can try to funnel cash into passions, adventures, new horizons, etc, but I don’t believe that you will ever really be able to buy what you’re looking for.<br /><br />

For the past month or so, I’ve been extra stressed about being able to find a job when I graduate. Machine learning is a difficult field, and the job market is not exactly taking anyone with a degree and a pulse. I want to be able to move to Orange County and start a new chapter of my life, but I’m afraid of what’ll happen if I don’t land a gig that’ll support my living expenses and keep me afloat down there, so I’ve been studying and learning a lot recently in preparation for the upcoming recruitment season. But as I take a step back from time to time, I realize the slippery slope that I stand at the top of.<br /><br />
Try as I might, I don’t think I’ll be able to suppress that underlying tenet of greed. Time can be traded for money, and when I get accustomed to a certain amount of money, I’ll look for more and more. The numbers will keep going up, and for what? Good food, a nice house, education for my kids, and anything that I want, I suppose. Those goals imply that a certain amount will be enough. I just hope that I don’t look back one day and realize that I worked a few hours too many each day, or a few weeks too many each year. That I’d spent what little time I had making a number go up, in the name of posterity, that my children will be able to make use of the savings I built up. The fortune grows and grows with each generation, as far as the eye can see, but I only live once. The end arrives inevitably, and I am simply not one to look into a future where I am already gone.<br /><br />

I’m not saying that I’m just going to spend all my money and not really care about what happens after I die. I’m trying to make the point that there should be a stopping point, perhaps well before the typical retirement age, that I should no longer care about making the number go up. That somewhere along the way, I stop wasting my days watching stock tickers or trying to maximize the amount in my savings.  A point where I can say, "Okay, this is enough," and start focusing on the things that do more than generate money.<br /><br />

I understand that this isn’t possible for everyone. The world is not a kind place for all, and sometimes hard work never stops for those who are trying to provide. It’s difficult, and I respect that immensely. But I’ve been given an opportunity to see what else is out there. I am the one who decides if I lose myself in my career and my finances, and I am the only one who can stop it.<br /><br />

Because at the end of the day, it’s not really about my parents, or my kids, or about using my time wisely to maximize the utility and comfort of my later years, or whatever they say these days. It’s just about wanting more, and I would like to not think about it even a second more than I absolutely must.</p>
