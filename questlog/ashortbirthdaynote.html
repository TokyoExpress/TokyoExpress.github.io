		<h1>A Brief Birthday Note</h1>
		<h3>For Ari Kim</h3>
    		<p>Happy birthday, sweetheart!</p>
		<p>I know you're not all that into birthdays or anything but this is quite a special day for me: it's my girlfriend's birthday! The end of March also means that it's less than two weeks until our 6-month anniversary. I hope you have been enjoying our relationship because it has made me so so happy.</p>
		<p>Congratulations on being 20 now! People always rave about 21, but in my opinion 20 feels a lot more substantial. It feels very different to say you're 20 years old now. And yeah, soon you will get used to it and realize that 20 is very very young, but for now I hope you are amused by this novelty of no longer being a teenager. I am so proud of you for wanting to make difficult decisions and not being afraid to learn more and work hard. Whatever you do, you will do great. And I have no doubt that you will garner the respect of everyone around you because you are a fantastic individual.</p>
		<p>But on the less professional side of things, you are the best girlfriend I could have ever asked for. You are loving, caring, and kind. Every day I am reminded of how lucky I am to have you as my partner. Loving you is very easy. You are very pretty and you have a good heart. The way you make me feel is so lovely, and I am so grateful that I have you in my life. I wish to have you by my side all the time and there is not a single thing that I would not want to share with you. You are the light of my life and I hope our futures remain hopelessly intertwined. You make everything fun and you make me smile so much.</p>
		<p>I guess I'll stop here for now; I did say this was going to be short. Happy birthday, my dear girl! You are everything and more than enough for me. May the years continue to fly by as we spend time together.</p>
		<p>Sam</p>
