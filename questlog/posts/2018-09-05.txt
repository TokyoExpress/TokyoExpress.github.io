title: What's Worth Doing
time: 3:30 PM

Too many times I've gone and set out to do something, just to give up on it because "it wouldn't be worth my time". And by that, I mean that it would take a long time to do and wouldn't even be that good. Basically, I'd avoid doing something that would be a 99% failure, even if it would help me get better in the long run. It just doesn't really make any sense to pour a few hours or days into a small project that won't even look/sound/be that good. It wouldn't even be presentable.

Technically, it would just be another form of practice. But practice is tangible. You understand when you're practicing, you're gradually getting better. Repetition and correction are key forms of regular practice. But when I undertake a small project or assignment for yourself as "practice",  I just can't help but feel like it's not really practice, like I'm actually trying to create something good and that attempting it at my current skill level would just be a huge waste of time. I don't really know.

I'm writing this because after like 4 hours of sitting at home today, I decided to see if I could copy a hard drawing to gain some experience. Of course, browsing through my list of saved artworks on Reddit, I would take one glance and be like "I have no idea how to do this, so I'm just not gonna do it". Eventually, I just reached the end of the list, accomplishing nothing and just gaining a large sense of inferiority.

Anyways, short post because I don't really have anything else to say on this topic. Posts are getting a little infrequent. Who cares, because no one reads this anyways. I'm serious lol I have analytics. Whatever. Not bitter. Maybe a little. After all, according to this post, this post itself was a waste of around 20 minutes.
