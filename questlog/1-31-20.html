		<h2>January 31, 2020</h2>
		<h1>A Fleeting Moment</h1>
		<h3>5:37 AM</h3>
		<p>It’s not too often anymore that I’m still up this late. Of course, going to bed in the early AMs has been the standard for me for many years, but I’m usually asleep by 3 or so, because I can’t afford to be sleepless when I have classes and events the next day. But every once in a while I’ll stumble upon one of these Thursday nights where nothing is really required of me the next morning, so I’ll feel no real motivation to go to sleep.</p>
		<p>The night is peaceful. It’s changed a bit as I’ve moved between different living situations, but it is always nice and quiet, with nothing but some soft music in the background.</p>
		<p>I actually no longer have time to finish this post; I’ve just decided to embark on an early morning adventure.</p>
		<p>I guess this just goes to show that the introspective stuff only goes so far. Who knows what I would’ve wrote on about? Probably something melancholy or wistful, but it looks like we’ll never know.</p>
		<p>Life’s too short to spend time finishing all of these.</p>
