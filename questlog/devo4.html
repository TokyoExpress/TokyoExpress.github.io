		<h1>#4: Peace</h1>
		<h3>March 2019</h3>
		<p>Peace is nothing more than resting in the truth.<br /><br />
When there is anxiety in my heart and unrest in my soul, then I have no peace.<br /><br />
Peace comes with the trust that everything is alright.<br /><br />
Peace comes with the surefire knowledge that it is all going to turn out fine.<br /><br />
Peace is not something that can be found in the world.<br /><br />
For the world is full of uncertainty, of belief in disbelief, of distractions that turn away from the light.<br /><br />
The world wants to tell the believer that there are no absolutes, that everything can change in the fraction of a second.<br /><br />
That nothing is guaranteed, and that there is no hope for when the earth turns upside down.<br /><br />
The world wants to tell me that I’m still not good enough.<br /><br />
That I must still keep working to improve myself, that I must always participate in this race.<br /><br />
And so I’m running day and night, because the world tells me I should run.<br /><br />
What is at the end of this race is entirely up to me, it seems.<br /><br />
Because I choose how I run, I determine my own finish line.<br /><br />
I am responsible for my own fate. I am in control.<br /><br />
At least that’s what they’d like to have me believe.<br /><br />
Because the thing about control is that it’s a double-edged sword.<br /><br />
Being in control gives a sense of independence, a reason to be proud that I have it all together.<br /><br />
And everything is fine, until I mess up.<br /><br />
Until I fail.<br /><br />
Until I can do nothing to change the situation.<br /><br />
Then control becomes not a virtue but a curse, a screaming voice that takes away all the pride, all the joy.
It’s my fault. It is my problem.<br /><br />
And because I am responsible, because I am the one in charge, because I am in control, I fall into despair.
Because the world is right.<br /><br />
I’m not good enough to run this race, and I will never be good enough.<br /><br />
What is there left to do but to sit in my hopelessness?<br /><br />
For the world does not believe in anything else.<br /><br />
But I do.<br /><br />
I believe in the higher calling, the greater identity.<br /><br />
A force powerful enough to bring me out of the darkness, out of despair.<br /><br />
A God that I can trust with control of my life.<br /><br />
So I can find victory, even if I’ll never be good enough.<br /><br />
I continue to run, but no longer for my own sake.<br /><br />
It’s just something to pass the time while I draw closer to the Light.<br /><br />
I don’t care about what’s at the end of the race, because I know what awaits me after it all.<br /><br />
My fate has been determined, not of my own volition, but of the will of He who is greater than me.<br /><br />
I’ve already won, and I can do nothing to change it.<br /><br />
So I rejoice, for I am powerless to steer myself away from salvation.<br /><br />
I need not worry, for I am not in control. I can’t mess this up, even if I tried.<br /><br />
This is truth, and as we’ve learned, what is true remains true.<br /><br />
And because of this truth, I have living, eternal hope.<br /><br />
And where there is hope, there is peace.<br /><br />
What is there left to do but to rest in it?<br /><br />
