		<h1>A Short Valentine</h1>
		<h3>For My Valentine</h3>
    		<p>Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart!</p>
		<p>It's about 4 in the morning right now and I really just didn't make time to write this thing, so I'll be quite brief. You are one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I love being with you and I want to talk to you all the time. I love your personality and your cute face and your attractive body and everything about you. Even when I'm dead tired or non-functional I'm still dreaming about you and wanting to send you good night texts and do special things for you. Thank you for letting me be someone special to you. I love you with all my heart and I am firmly committed to seeing this all the way through because you make me so happy and I want to do the same for you. I want to make you happy for the rest of my days; I want to study it, experiment, research, practice, improve, and I am not letting you have even the slightest break from my love. I'm so passionate about you because you are such a sweet girl and a beautiful woman and I am so grateful that I get to call you mine. You are my partner and my adventuring buddy and I am so glad that I have you to do things with and live life with. I am always excited about our future and the things we will see and do. You are my best friend and my favorite girl, and I wish you the happiest of Valentine's Day, for you are the only one on my mind. I love you and I will see you very soon, dear.</p>
