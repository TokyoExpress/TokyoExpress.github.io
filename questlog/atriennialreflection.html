		<h1>A Triennial Reflection</h1>
		<h3>For My Partner</h3>
        <p>The last time I wrote one of these in May 2022, we were both still in Santa Barbara, spending our days together under the sun in that little college town and campus. It's a bit surreal to think that so much time has passed that neither of us are there anymore in the place where we first met. I guess that's just how young life is, though - always moving on and up to better and different things. I am sure that a few years from now we will have even more phases of life under our belt, with new experiences, friends, and interests to show for them. But before we look to the future, let's take a look in the past at some of the things that have happened since then:</p>
        <p><b>May 2022:</b> We went to Six Flags with some of our friends, right before I graduated from UCSB. I'm glad I'm able to ride rollercoasters with you now, even if we have to skip the loopy spinny ones. I hope we can go to other ones like Universal Orlando or Hersheypark.</p>
        <p><b>June 2022:</b> We had a date day in San Francisco! Thanks for planning everything and showing me around town.</p>
        <p><b>July / August 2022:</b> We hung out at my apartment a few times before you left to study abroad. Come to think of it, that was probably pretty new to us, since we had never had our own place (room) while we were in college. I always looked forward to you arriving; and even though the house was small and cramped I was very glad that we were still able to have time together.</p>
        <p><b>November 2022:</b> I came and visited you in Seoul. That was a very fun week and I loved exploring all the areas with you like the fancy Baskin Robbins and the shop alleys at night. One of my fond memories from that trip is that time we got caught in the heavy rain after eating fried chicken and we just started laughing. I really felt like everything in the world could be okay at that moment. Over these past couple of years, a lot of things have been hard so we're probably a little more serious than we used to be, but I really hope we can try to keep having those moments.  I hope we can visit again and also go to Taiwan and Japan and other countries.</p>
        <p><b>January 2023:</b> We had a few more date days after you came back from Korea. We played mini golf in Ghirardelli Square and went to the Academy of Sciences. I remember it was quite rainy and gloomy during that time of the year.</p>
        <p><b>February 2023:</b> I came down to SB for the weekend and we got oysters and stayed in Ventura for a night. We also went to a thrift store the day after.</p>
        <p><b>March / April 2023:</b> You came up to San Francisco to visit me a few times. We went shopping one day and got dinner the next night (I think some Italian place in the south area of Mission). We also went to the SF Zoo another time. Honestly my time in SF feels like a blur; I can't really remember all of it super well. All I know is that I was always happy when you came to see me.</p>
        <p><b>June 2023:</b> We visited Orange County again and spent our first evening at the TWICE concert at SoFi Stadium. We left in the middle of the last encore song so that we could exit the parking structure early and it worked super well! After the concert we went and got some Mexican food and ate it in my car. We also attended another SB graduation for our friends.</p>
        <p><b>July 2023:</b> We went to Mammoth with some friends. It was a pretty hectic trip but it was very fun.</p>
        <p><b>August 2023:</b> Some more SF shenanigans after I found out that I was leaving the city. We went to the Exploratorium, Dolores Park, and finally the Sausalito day trip. I had such a great time biking around the town with you and seeing all the quaint little shops and roads. DC has some nice biking trails so I hope we can do something like that again when you visit me next.</p>
        <p><b>November 2023:</b> You came to visit me in DC for the first time! We did so many things; we went to all these museums on the Mall and the zoo and ate a lot of food. I thought it was really cute how excited you got to see the White House and the other landmarks. My favorite thing about travelling with you is seeing your reactions to things like nice views and good food.</p>
        <p><b>December 2023:</b> We saw each other for a couple days around SF when I came back to California for the holidays. We went to the Conservatory of Flowers and a Dave and Buster's. I hope we can do more cute couple dates like arcades and fairs and stuff.</p>
        <p><b>February 2024:</b> We didn't see each other, but you sent me some flowers for Valentine's Day which I thought was very sweet. I am so lucky to have someone who thinks of me and cares for me so much. I am still trying to keep that one flower alive somehow but I am not sure what I am going to do with it.</p>
        <p><b>June / July 2024:</b> I attended your graduation in SB. Now there is not really a reason for us to go back, but I hope that we will someday to just reminisce about our time together there. After that, we were in DC together for probably the longest time in the last 2 years. I really enjoyed just living everyday life with you. I hope it was a sneak peek into all the fun normal things we will do once we are together in person.</p>
        <p><b>October 2024:</b> My birthday dinner at Lutece and camping in Shenandoah with friends.</p>
        <p>It makes me happy to look back and think about all the memories we have together. Even though not every single one of our memories are all good and happy, I think that I am so fortunate to be able to be so close to you and live life together with you. You know me better than anyone else in this world, and I hope you feel the same way about me. It is a joy and a blessing to be able to share facts, experiences, food, opinion, conversation, silence, and anything and everything with you. I look forward to the next few years and I cannot wait to see what sorts of new things we go through and discover with each other. That being said, while I do hope that our years are filled with grand memories and first-time experiences, it is still the everyday things about us that make me happy. I hope that we have so many mundane and simple memories that we can't even keep track of them anymore, and each day is filled with its own small moments between us.</p>
        <p>You are my perfect partner, so lovely and sweet, and you continue to be the light of my life. I like that whenever something happens to me I can tell you, and I like that I also get an intimate look at what happens in your life as well. I like that we can talk about secret or controversial things and laugh and be comfortable with each other. I like being able to wake up next to you and go through the day with you. I don't really know what my life would look like if I didn't have you to share it with, but I cannot imagine it. Everything is just so much better when I can talk about it with you or experience it with you. I wish to go through another 3 years, and then another 4, and then another 10, and another 20, and on and on. There is just so much fun and joy to be had when I'm with you. You are cute, pretty, beautiful, funny, amazing, smart, caring, kind, and all of the above. And most of all, you are so so special to me and you make me so very happy.</p>
        <p>And yeah, I know I just wrote down a list of the stuff we did for the last 2 years. I did have fun going over the memories though, and I hope you did too. I'll have to think a bit harder on what to write for the next time, now that I'm trying to do these semi-regularly again. Anywaysâ€¦</p>
        <p>I love you.</p>
        <p>- Sam</p>
