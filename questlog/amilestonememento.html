		<h1>A Milestone Memento</h1>
		<h3>For My One and Only</h3>
    		<p>Tomorrow is our 6th month anniversary.</p>
        <p>We'll probably have to celebrate on Wednesday, after your midterm. Sometimes I forget that we are students and thus have slightly different lives than your typical working adult couple. Even so, I am so proud of us for making it this far. You are an astoundingly mature woman and I am so glad that I get to go through thick and thin with you by my side. When I think about the fact that we've been together for half a year, I am really not surprised at all. It actually seems a little strange to me how short that seems - I could really be with you for years and years. And yes, I know that it's all speculation and hopefulness, but as I told you on our first week, I really am serious about you. I believe we can make it through, and I don't even think it will be difficult. There will be hard days and various obstacles, but I have no doubt that we will grow tremendously and give so much love. You make me so happy and I am always here to build you up and walk with you. We are a team and a pair and it gives me security to think of the chemistry and commitment we have.</p>
        <p>I know you've been feeling a lot of things recently, but I want to let you know that I am here by your side whenever you need me. Being this age is tough, and I know that there are so many emotions and feelings that are going through your head. I will always stay with you until we figure it out. You have been patient with my issues and have shown me grace, and nothing would make me happier than to do the same for my favorite person and my very best friend. We are so good together! I hope you feel the same way. I love having you in my life and you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you so much.</p>
        <p>This is the fourth or fifth letter you've gotten from me, so it should be no surprise that you are the cutest, hottest, loveliest, and most wonderful girlfriend I could have ever asked for. I am so grateful to have a significant other that loves me and understands me like you do. I hope I make you happy, dear. You will always be my darling princess and the love of my life. I still love staring at your face and just watching you from a distance. You are a fascinating individual and I never get tired of our dumb little jokes. Thank you for sharing your fun moments with me and I promise there will be many, many more.</p>
        <p>I hope and pray that six months becomes six years, and that one day I can get down on one knee and we can begin a wonderful adventurous life together. I will keep trying to show you all the love that I can, and it is my goal and ambition to keep surprising you and make you swoon. I love to see you smile.</p>
        <p>Anyways, I was a little backed up on ideas so the anniversary gifts will be a bit late. They'll come, though. You will, too, probably sometime very soon. It gives me hope for the future and enthusiasm for the present to have someone like you in my life, my one and only lover. I suppose this is more of a formal and longer letter, so I will sign off appropriately. I love you, sweetheart.</p>
        <p>Sincerely yours and yours always,</p>
		<p>Samuel Z Guo</p>
