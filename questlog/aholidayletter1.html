		<h1>A Holiday Letter</h1>
		<h3>#1</h3>
    		<p>Happy Thanksgiving, Ari!</p>
		<p>I've decided to write you one of these whenever I can't see you, which hopefully isn't too often. Gifts were never really my strong suit and getting the timings of shipping and other logistical things right can be quite annoying, so I hope these can suffice to show that I'm thinking of you during these times. As always, I wish for your general wellness and I hope you are feeling happy! You can always let me know if you need anything, I promise it brings me great joy to be able to support you in any way.</p>
		<p>It is Thanksgiving, so I guess I should probably start with saying that I'm extremely thankful for you! For having gotten to know you, for being able to share these times with you, and for the opportunity to get to know you more and more every day. Meeting you and getting close to you has been the highlight of these past few months for me and I thank God that I was able to run into you in my last year of college. Coincidences and perfect timing are things that are easy for me to dismiss as the whims and luck of the universe, but this quarter continues to give me faith and hope that the plans and blessings from above can be more than just random events. As cheesy as that sounds. I'm sure if I read that line from somewhere else I would definitely say it was super <i>cringe</i>, but I suppose I'm willing to become a little cringe for the sake of romance.</p>
		<p>Thank you for being a good friend throughout the time we've known each other. Thanks for being there to comfort me in my moments of stress. Thank you for being patient with my shortcomings and caring for me, even though I'm still getting used to letting others help me. Thanks for putting up with my stubbornness and bad jokes. Thank you for being genuine and open with me, and thanks for spending all this time with me. I appreciate you like no other and I'm grateful to have you in my life.</p>
		<p>I know I can be quite nonchalant at times; I'm still very cautious with my relationships. I'm sometimes still hesitant to let people know that I care about them for fear of coming on too strong or becoming a nuisance to those I want to stick around. But I'm not afraid with you. You're comfortable and warm to me, and I don't want to hold back my feelings for you. I think about you all the time and I think you are such a fantastic person. I am so happy whenever I spend time with you and I can't help but smile whenever you text me. I enjoy how our conversations are lighthearted and natural, and I have never not had fun hanging out with you. I hope you also know that you are drop-dead gorgeous. Whenever there's a lull or silence for a few seconds, it's probably just because I'm spacing out staring at you.
		<p>I'm sorry, I know words of affirmation are not at the top of either of our lists. I just like to give it a shot every once in a while. You're my girlfriend now, but I still have a crush on you, and I hope that doesn't go away for a long time. Amidst all of this, you remain one of my closest friends. I'm continually looking for all the ways to tell you how much I value you. I don't really know what the etiquette is for saying "I love you" in these relationships (apologies if I was supposed to wait for a specified amount of time), but I do love you! I hope that doesn't cause any complications; you can interpret it in a more acceptable context if you wish because there are actually six to eight forms of love defined by the Ancient Greeks and each one encompasses... I'm sure I can tell you another time.</p>
		<p>So happy Thanksgiving, Ari Kim! I'll see you soon. Let us keep exploring what this earth has to offer.</p>
		<p>- Sam</p>
