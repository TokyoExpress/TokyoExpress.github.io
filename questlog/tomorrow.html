		<h2>Works</h2>
		<h1>Tomorrow</h1>
		<h3>February 2018</h3>
		<p>At 6:45 A.M., he is abruptly woken up to the sound of Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me To The Moon". Once one of his favorite songs, it has now become the incarnation of misery itself. He wrestles with the sheets, but they overpower him: he'd stayed up too late last night. He contemplates calling in sick for the day, just to enjoy a few more hours of sleep.</p>
		<p>At 6:57 A.M., just before the alarm reaches its seventh iteration of â€˜Jupiter and Mars', he crawls out of bed, wanting to avoid a "low productivity" lecture from his division manager. He looks for a Pop-Tart, but it has been nine days since he ran out of them. Reluctantly accepting this predicament, he drinks a glass of milk and begins his forty-three minute commute to the office.</p>
		<p>At 7:51 A.M., he loses the last shred of motivation to work.</p>
		<p>At 12:43 P.M., he watches a three-minute YouTube video ("How to Paint a Simple Landscape: For Beginners") for the twelfth time. For a brief moment, he remembers the canvas and art palette he had ordered from Amazon four months ago, still sitting in the hallway, unopened.</p>
		<p>His boss reminds him that he gets paid to write software and not to browse the Internet.</p>
		<p>At 5:29 P.M., he passes by the untouched package in the hallway on his way to the living room. It has begun to collect a fair amount of dust. He pauses for a second, but continues. He needs to relax and watch TV after work, and he could always pick up painting another time.</p>
		<p>At 10:14 P.M., he closes the last of fourteen Wikipedia tabs after spending two hours reading about various Napoleonic Wars, Japanese destroyer ship Shigure, and the little-known island of Aitutaki. They were quite interesting, and he's learned a lot about them. Maybe someday the knowledge will come in handy.</p>
		<p>At 11:43 P.M., he remembers that he has to buy Pop-Tarts, but all the stores are closed. No matter, he thinks. He could go one more day without breakfast.</p>
		<p>At 1:37 A.M., he is consumed by guilt. It's already late at night, yet he's made no progress towards his goals. How did all those hours simply waltz away? Cursing his inactivity, he sits back in his office chair and thinks. He wishes he could focus on pursuing his passions.</p>
		<p>He wants to try. He knows he could become an artist if he practiced. He just needed the right motivation. Once he put in the effort, the results would inevitably show up. With the correct combination of dedication and willpower, he'd be able to accomplish anything. He is suddenly filled with a rush of adrenaline, excited by the thought of future success. He feels proactive. He believes in himself. He can do it. He's ready to begin his journey to achievement, step by step.</p>
		<p>But it's too late to start now. The day is over. Tomorrow, he tells himself. Surely tomorrow he'd get something done. He happily gets into bed, eagerly awaiting the progress-filled day that awaits him.</p>
		<p>At 6:45 A.M., he is abruptly woken up to the sound of Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me To The Moon".</p>
