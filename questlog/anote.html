		<p>Ari,</p>
    <p>I'm sorry for getting in the way for so long. My pride and arrogance, my anxiety, my stubbornness, my low emotional intelligence - I understood too late just how much hurt and frustration I was inflicting on you and I realize now how much I have to work on and improve for myself. I hope you are healing.</p>
    <p>I wish you the best and I will be praying for you as you begin school. You are intelligent, diligent, wise beyond your years, and one of the most capable and resourceful people I know. I have no doubt that you will achieve anything that you set your sights on. I am so proud of you.</p>
