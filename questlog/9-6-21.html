		<h2>September 6, 2021</h2>
		<h1>Long Drives and Days Off</h1>
		<h3>12:12 AM</h3>
		<p>I’m spending the long weekend at home in NorCal before going back to school for the academic year. It’s been pretty chill and there’s not that much to do around here, but I keep feeling like I should’ve brought something to work on or thought of an activity that would occupy a good chunk of time. I saw Shang-Chi in theatres tonight and will probably be out for a while tomorrow with some old friends, but other than that, I’ve kinda just been sitting around at home, playing League and watching Haikyuu! episodes on and off.<br /><br />

There shouldn’t be a problem with this - actually let me rephrase - There isn’t a problem with this. Rest days are important and it’s good to take some time off and relax to ensure that burnout doesn’t set in. So why does it feel so strange to do nothing right now?<br /><br />

Aside from my usual tendencies to place unnecessarily high expectations for myself, I think it’s probably because I’ve been wrestling with a few short-long term decisions and goals. I’m calling them short-long term because they’re not necessarily super short-term (actually one of them is, but it’s not really a goal). I’m supposed to find a job this year so that when I graduate I can start living on my own and being financially independent. Quite a tall order for new grads in this day and age, but I have a long year to be able to get work done and put my best foot forward.<br /><br />

But that’s the thing: a year is long, but every day in that year is an opportunity to get things done and move forward. Every day that you spend resting and not taking advantage of that time is just time that’s gone, and if you reach the deadline and don’t have anything to show for it, you’ll always be lamenting those days that you didn’t seize and the time that you could’ve improved yourself or given it a better shot. I guess that’s my fear when it comes to rest days. I understand that rest is important, but I am afraid that I will fall into a comfortable pattern of not getting anything done and watching the days fly by with absolutely no progress.<br /><br />

Despite all of these thoughts and my inevitable conclusion that some sort of balance must be achieved (in this case a good amount of rest but also ambition and diligence to counter), I trust the process. There are some times that you just can’t force yourself to work. The 4-hour long drive home was a good example - I could have done some critical thinking and brainstorming while driving, but that just doesn’t seem to make any sense. It was much more natural to listen to some new music and try to enjoy the feeling of not really having to do anything.<br /><br />

Weekends, plans to look forward to, hour-long breaks at the end of the day, and more. It may seem busy but there’s always room to take a nice break and recharge for the journey ahead.<br /><br />

I have another long drive tomorrow. It is what it is. But after that, I’ll be back on the grind for a little bit, until I get a little worn out and have to take some time off again. That’s okay - life isn’t about always going up or moving forward all of the time. It’s an ebb and flow, a balance of comfort and frustration, happiness and sadness, reminiscence and looking forward.<br /><br />

This one’s rather short; I had some more stuff planned but I kind of forgot where I was really going to go with it. I had a good weekend, though. That seems to be all that matters at the moment.
