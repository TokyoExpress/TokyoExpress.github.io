		<h2>Writing Portfolio</h2>
		<h1>Samuel Guo</h1>
		<h3>Skills and Inventory</h3>
		<p>I create meaningful and interesting content to serve whatever purposes you need: blog posts, articles, etc. I specialize in writing on lifestyle, self-improvement, and the creative arts, although I am also quite adept at technical writing and copywriting. You can get a pretty accurate idea of my writing style and niche by browsing the posts on this blog. I have also selected a number of them to include as samples at the bottom of this page.</p>
		<p>I write high-quality pieces to suit any of your  needs, all done with professional courtesy in an exceptionally quick timeframe. I can do informative, I can do compelling, I can do thought-provoking, I can do whimsical. All of them at once, if you'd prefer. But I guarantee that it is always something worth reading: both to you and your target audience.</p>
		<p>Topics I write about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-Improvement and Motivation</li>
			<li>Thoughts and Feelings</li>
			<li>Lifestyle and Mindset</li>
			<li>Graphic and UX Design</li>
			<li>Goals and Achievements</li>
			<li>Video Games, Movies, Media and Entertainment</li>
			<li>Music</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What I can make:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Blog Posts</li>
			<li>Web Content</li>
			<li>Journalism</li>
			<li>Press Releases</li>
			<li>Help and Manuals</li>
			<li>Reports and Proposals</li>
			<li>Ghostwriting</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sample content:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="12-23-19.html">The New Order</a> (Lifestyle and Mindset)</li>
			<li><a href="12-30-19.html">To See the Future</a> (Thoughts and Feelings)</li>
			<li><a href="12-31-19.html">Motivation, Part 1</a> (Self-Improvement and Motivation)</li>
			<li><a href="8-22-18.html">A Year's Reflection</a> (Goals and Achievements)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you've got a space that you'd like to fill with truly thought-provoking and well-written content, I have the solution for you. I can work with all kinds of topics, budgets, and timeframes, and I'll make sure that the job is done smoothly and complication-free.</p>
