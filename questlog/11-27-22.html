		<h2>November 27, 2022</h2>
		<h1>Change</h1>
		<h3>3:37 AM</h3>
		<p>It’s been a little over a year. Things are a little bit different now: I’ve graduated from college and have moved to San Francisco, closer to my hometown. I did some fun things and met a good amount of people in the last year, most notably my girlfriend who has quite significantly impacted the trajectory of my life for the better. Altogether, this is what I wanted: to move to the next stage of life and see what’s in store. At least that’s what I wanted, a little while ago. Now I find myself caught up in a new story once again, for better or for worse. I’m not sure exactly what to do these days. I just know that things have changed.<br /><br />

All my life, I’ve had an ambivalent relationship with change. Things have to change. You grow up, you move on, you keep going. Every once in a while, I look back to a previous time and reminisce on those old moments. And as much as I treasure those memories, I know that they cannot be recreated. That’s just the way it is. Entropy of the universe, or something. Everything cannot stay the same. But I do wonder, if given the chance, would I go back? Would I forgo the progress and experiences up until now, all I’ve seen and done in the past year, just to be back in that moment where nothing has changed? Probably not, I suppose. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. But somewhere along the path you realize there is no going back. That while you’ve been slowly climbing and exploring, the worlds you left behind have begun to shift as well. You don’t have to go home to know that it will all be different. And although I have never been regretful of the paths I chose and the time I’ve spent away, I do often wish that the things I’ve come to appreciate and enjoy would stick around. That the friends I made in college could still live a block or two away, or that I could still get a Jack-in-the-Box munchie meal at 2:00 in the morning with some hometown friends and talk about the girls we liked. Though I am lucky that through everything, many of the relationships and simple pleasures in life have stayed with me until now.<br /><br /> 

I suppose that even if you sit still and do nothing, the world will change all the same, so you might as well get your own adventure in while it happens. I don’t quite have any good advice for how to deal with all the change, though. That’s still something I’m trying to figure out myself. When I first moved to San Francisco, there was so much to figure out that I could hardly afford the time to think about such things. The last time I’d moved to a new environment was when I started college, four years ago. This post isn’t really about how to explore a new city and make friends, though, so I’ll save that for another time. Or maybe I’m just bad at writing now that it’s been over a year since I made one of these. Who knows? But in the interest of actually finishing this and getting something out, I’ll just say that I have now gotten much more comfortable and settled, and although I feel there is still much missing, I have reached a point where I am free to think and ponder once again while I figure things out.<br /><br />

Anyways, I’ve been thinking about the change. More specifically, I’ve been very curious as to what my friends and peers are doing now that we’ve graduated college. It’s like now that I’ve become self-aware of my own postgrad journey, I have to figure out what other people are doing. I have to say that it hasn’t exactly been for adventurous, knowledge-gaining purposes, though. More often than not I am comparing myself to others and trying to determine the scope of possible paths - mostly to see how mine fares across them all. With change comes uncertainty, and I am always afraid that I am going in the wrong direction.<br /><br />

And of course, I know the textbook answer. Everyone’s path is different, and any amount of exploration in any direction is valuable. Your life is special because it is uniquely your experience, and you should celebrate the change in your life as it leads you to new heights and pleasant surprises. But something you should learn about this lesson, as well as all of the lessons before  this, is that it is not easily followed. The truth of this world is difficult to swallow. You will fall down, and on an objective scale perhaps you might not be doing as well as others. There is nothing you can do about that except hope and pray that everyone else is screwing it up somehow. That you’re not the only one feeling lost and hopeless in the waves. And if that turns out to not be true, well, I don’t know what would happen. But I’d like to tell you that you’re not alone. I’m here. Every day I wish to take a step in the right direction. I’m deathly afraid of what happens if I don’t, and more often than not, I don’t take any steps at all. In the past few months I’ve made little to no progress on most of my goals, and I  have no idea how to change that. The whole risk-taking thing where I said that I’m happy to jump into uncharted territory and face whatever I find there - I’m sorry, but it’s not really me.<br /><br />

But I’m still trying. I can change. I want to change. I want to become the person I’ve been telling you all to be: fearless, humble, enthusiastic, thoughtful, caring, and incorruptible. And although I carry with me a quarter of a lifetime’s worth of insecurities and envy, I want to keep moving towards the light. Even if I have to rewrite this post a hundred times, each after another long, difficult stage of life, I want to be the person that doesn’t give up on change.<br /><br />

I know things will never stop moving. Up until the day I die, the people I know, the places I’ve been, and the things that I remember so vividly will continue to change, little by little, until they are just barely recognizable. But something will always remain - a friendship, or a memory, or something like that. Maybe even just a feeling you’d forgotten about. Perhaps it’s insignificant, compared to all that once was back then. But I believe that it’s enough to make a difference - in the things you want, the things that you strive for, the way you act. I’d like to think that the good old days live on within us, and when the changing tides sweep them away, it’s up to us to keep them alive in some way. How exactly to do that, I’m afraid I’m not sure. I’ll be working on it.<br /><br />

Most of the happenings on this earth are out of our control. But if I find a string to pull, I’ll do my best to see what happens.</p>
