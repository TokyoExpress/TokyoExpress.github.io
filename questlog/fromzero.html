		<h2>Works</h2>
		<h1>From Zero</h1>
		<h3>September 2016</h3>
		<p> Imagine if you were suddenly teleported to a parallel universe. In this universe, practically everything is foreign to you, save the existence of humans and their language. What would you do? Such is the plot of television show Re:Zero, short for "Re: Life in another world from zero". The show follows a young man named Natsuki Subaru who finds himself stuck in a fantasy parallel world that does not remotely resemble his home continent of Japan. Additionally, he obtains the ability to â€˜reset' to an earlier moment every time he dies. He soon meets a girl named Emilia, whom he becomes infatuated with. Subaru and Emilia face formidable enemies, and Subaru is often forced to watch her die gruesome deaths, before he too is killed and sent back in time. These events have a profound impact on his psychological well-being, destroying all traces of optimism and happiness. Re:Zero utilizes the actions of Natsuki Subaru to portray the message that one who tries to take on everything alone is often left devastated by the results of his/her actions, highlighting the consequences of the "lone-wolf mentality" that many people of the real world seem to maintain.<br /><br />

 Although Subaru is equipped with the power to essentially be immortal, he is inept to the point that it usually takes four or more tries to pass a "checkpoint" without dying. Even so, Subaru continually refuses to depend on others, determined to be the hero of his own story even as he fails repeatedly. Psychiatrist Carl Jung states that "it is often tragic to see how blatantly a man bungles his own life and the lives of others yet remains totally incapable of seeing how much the whole tragedy originates in himself, and how he continually feeds it and keeps it going". Subaru is almost a perfect representation of Jung's explanation; he refuses to acknowledge that "the tragedy originates in himself", and proceeds to force his help onto others. Each time Subaru fails to save the two of them, Emilia has no recollection of it as the universe resets itself. Subaru is aware of the imminent danger that lies ahead, yet does not inform her of the situation. Instead, he simply tags along and expects himself to save the day, which he usually does not. Because Subaru fails to recognize that he is the root of the problem, he constantly causes problems for his companions, despite his seemingly good intentions.<br /><br />

 The effects of Subaru's actions on his mental well-being are overwhelmingly negative. Seeing someone he loves die over and over again forces him to try excessively to prevent it, which slowly changes him for the worse. He eventually becomes a furious and anxious person that people refuse to be associated with. Subaru's benevolence takes a turn for the worse, as his actions no longer reflect a desire to save the one he loves but a twisted attempt to prove his own self-worth, a testament to the pain he has been through, which, ironically, could have been averted had he lowered his ego and requested the assistance of his friends. But because Subaru is hellbent on being a lone wolf, he begins to see those around him not as his allies but incompetent people that need to be saved by the one true hero: himself. Subaru's stubbornness destroys himself and additionally causes his relationships to crumble. When Emilia refuses to let him travel with her, he lashes out at her, shouting that she should be forever indebted to him for saving her the first time they met. His friends and companions slowly fade away from his side, and he is left alone with a tragedy of a life. His mentality offers an example of one that watchers should steer clear of, lest they meet the same fate.<br /><br />

 Re:Zero tells the tale of someone who started from zero and returned to zero, due to his inability to accept his own failures and use them to correct his life. Natsuki Subaru is the living incarnation of Carl Jung's idea of someone who unceasingly extends his own nightmare. Because he refused to accept help from others and was unable to see his own faults, he drove his life into the ground. Natsuki Subaru is Re:Zero's ultimate tool to display the idea that an excess of independence and confidence in one's self will invariably spell disaster. Luckily for Subaru, this is not where the story ends. He eventually recognizes his failures and corrects his relationships, remembering to ask for assistance this time around. His actions later on prove that even someone who had the worst mentality and the most stubborn actions has the ability to make a success out of a tragedy - from zero.<br /><br /></p>
