I look up and I see a mountain, a wall, a fortress, a hundred miles tall. I cannot see the top, let alone imagine how I can get there. I stand at the bottom, tired and weary. If I had the strength to take the first step, I would. But I'm not even sure what it would be. I don't think I'm capable of getting to the top. I am honestly not sure that I even understand what it means to be at the top.

Maybe I am convinced that my first step has to be correct, that it has to be in the right direction. But maybe it doesn't have to be. Still I am scared, scared to make a wrong move, to fail again. But what have I to lose? I am already at the bottom. I have already lost so much.

I don't know what my goal is. To be better? To be happy? These goals seem so ethereal and abstract. I fear that I will not be able to know whether or not I have made any progress towards fulfilling them.
