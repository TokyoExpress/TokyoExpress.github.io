		<h1>A Short Valentine</h1>
		<h3>For My Valentine</h3>
    		<p>Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart!</p>
		<p>It's about 4 in the morning right now and I really just didn't make time to write this thing. So I'll be quite brief. You are one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I love being with you and I want to talk to you all the time. I love your personality and your cute face and your attractive body and everything about you. Even when I'm dead tired or non functional I'm still dreaming about you and wanting to send you good night texts and do special things for you. Thank you for letting me be someone special to you. I love you with all my heart and I am firmly committed to seeing this all the way through. You are my partner and my adventuring buddy and I am so glad that I have you to do things with and live life with. I am always excited about our future and the things we will see and do. You are my best friend and my favorite girl, and I wish you the happiest of Valentine's Day, for you are the only one on my mind. I love you and I will see you very soon, dear.</p>
