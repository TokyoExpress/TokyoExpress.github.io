		<h2></h2>
		<p>Ari,</p>
    <p>I'm sorry for getting in the way for so long. My pride and arrogance, my anxiety, my stubbornness, my low emotional intelligence - I inflicted so much hurt and frustration on you and I deeply regret the way I wore you and your patience down. I have a lot to work on and improve for myself, from the inside out. I hope you are healing.</p>
    <p>I wish you the best and I will be praying for you as you begin school. I want to assure you - you are intelligent, diligent, wise beyond your years, and one of the most capable and resourceful people I know. I have no doubt that you will achieve anything and everything that you set your sights on. I am so proud of you.</p>
    <p><i>7/18 - I trust that you'll be fine on your own, but if you're ever having a really hard time, I'm here for you. No expectations and no strings attached.</i></p>
