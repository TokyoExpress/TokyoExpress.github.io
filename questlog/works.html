		<p>Here you'll find little things I've written here and there that are either a little too long or standalone to be part of my blog. Disclaimer: they get more and more low quality the longer ago they were written, so don't expect too much out of them. After all, I am first and foremost a nonfiction author. But worldbuilding and characterization is always fun, and these are just lying around anyways.</p>

		<p><b>Essays and Other Academia</b></p>
		<dl>
			<dt><a href="fromzero.html">From Zero</a></dt>
			<dd>We now enter the meme zone. This is literally an anime essay I wrote in high school for a fall writing assessment. And after I finished importing it, I realized that it's actually incredibly short. Enjoy. Written around September 2016.</dd>
			<dt><a href="onodera.html">A Matter of Good Taste</a></dt>
			<dd>Another anime essay. This one was written during second semester senior year (Early 2018), so unlike the previous entry, it has no intention of being either serious or coherent. Pretty much just for kicks. This is probably one of the worst things I've ever written. Bon appetit.</dd>
