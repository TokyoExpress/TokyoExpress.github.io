		<h2>Works</h2>
		<h1>#2: Commitment</h1>
		<h3>February 2019</h3>
		<p>I apologize, Lord, for I have not been a faithful servant.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have not accepted your work in my life today.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have not lived up to my faith.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have not honored the commitment I made many years ago.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have not honored the commitment I made a few weeks ago.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have not honored the commitment I made just the day before.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for I have ignored the one truth you have given me.<br /><br />
For I am easy and suggestible, and I go wherever the wind blows.<br /><br />
I am as you created me, Lord, with the potential to become your vessel, to do great things in Your name.<br /><br />
But I am also as you created me, Lord, with flaws, trapped within the walls of three dimensions, with five senses and a plethora of infinite thoughts that have been turned against me, Lord.<br /><br />
Lord, sometimes I am unable to tell whether it is You in my mind or the enemy!<br /><br />
The enemy is so crafty, and his lies are so sweet.<br /><br />
I must admit that at countless times I have found myself trapped within his snares.<br /><br />
And I must admit that most of the time I have enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />
For when I am down and worn out, the enemy seems to be my friend.<br /><br />
And even now, in the calm and peace, he seems to be my friend.<br /><br />
But Lord, I have so many friends.<br /><br />
I have so many things that bring me joy in this world.<br /><br />
Is it really true that I must forsake all of them in order to see Your face?<br /><br />
If that is a truth as well, then I am at a loss for what to do.<br /><br />
Or rather, I know what I must do, but I am unsure of the commitment.<br /><br />
Commitment is already hard enough within the confines of this universe.<br /><br />
Don’t You understand how impossible it would be to remain committed to You, Lord?<br /><br />
You who is invisible to the eye and silent to the ear?<br /><br />
You who works behind the scenes so we can never be sure of how You are?<br /><br />
You, whose very existence is at the same time so personal yet so mysterious?<br /><br />
Of course You do, Lord.<br /><br />
You are omniscient, and You know the very thoughts I write down right now.<br /><br />
I apologize, Lord, for doubting You today.<br /><br />
I don’t want to spend my life running around and getting hurt, only to return to You to be healed once more.<br /><br />
And yet I know, Lord, I know, that even if I do this for the next year, the next decade, the next century, until the very day that I die.<br /><br />
You will always embrace me with loving arms.<br /><br />
I thank You for that, O Lord.<br /><br />
But I want more than this.<br /><br />
I want to be Your servant every day, every hour, and every second of my life, Lord.<br /><br />
I want to truly be committed.<br /><br />
Because if I believe in these truths, then it is effortless.<br /><br />
It simply becomes a part of who I am.<br /><br />
So I pray, Lord. Not for instant change, nor for You to grant me all that I am lacking.<br /><br />
I just ask that You stay with me as I continue to walk with You.<br /><br />
