		<h1>A Christmas Poem</h1>
		<h3>For My Lovely Significant Other</h3>
    		<p>‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house,<br /><br /> Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br /><br /> The stockings were hung by the chimney with glee,<br /><br /> But not that type of stockings, unfortunately.<br /><br /> Ari was sleeping all snug in her bed,<br /><br /> While I lay here thinking of rhymes in my head.<br /><br /> For I saw someone parody this poem online,<br /><br /> And thought it’d be cute if I did it for mine.<br /><br /> It’s dreary without you amidst all the rain,<br /><br /> So let’s take a quick walk down memory lane.<br /><br /> I know this all happened quite recently,<br /><br /> But it’s romantic to reminisce, wouldn’t you agree?<br /><br /> The first time I saw you, I have to admit,<br /><br /> It was fun talking, but I didn’t think much of it.<br /><br /> Within a week though, I’m embarrassed to say<br /><br /> That I started planning far beyond today.<br /><br /> A grand scheme of sorts, with a much grander prize,<br /><br /> A girl with dazzling asymmetrical eyes.<br /><br /> So I got your number, but the hard part was next,<br /><br /> Spending all day thinking of what to text.<br /><br /> But slowly and surely you began to appear,<br /><br /> While I found myself doting and holding you dear.<br /><br /> Even still it seemed we were so far apart,<br /><br /> So I really hoped you wouldn’t break my heart.<br /><br /> But although I was afraid, I pressed on with hope,<br /><br /> Giving up on such a cute girl was definitely a nope.<br /><br /> I tried to be proactive and find things in common;<br /><br /> But I guess I really just had to ask for ramen.<br /><br /> I’ll never forget just how much brighter<br /><br /> My smile was when we pulled that all-nighter.<br /><br /> All through that weekend I was filled with delight,<br /><br /> My happy ending was finally in sight.<br /><br /> When you came back from your trip in LA,<br /><br /> Making you mine I just could not delay.<br /><br /> The first time we went out was indeed very sweet,<br /><br /> Walking up and down that dimly lit street.<br /><br /> I’m glad that being up there seeing the stars,<br /><br /> Is a moment that will only ever be ours.<br /><br /> From there we began to be more than friends,<br /><br /> Finding new excitement in the time we did spend.<br /><br /> Walking around campus; cooking good meals;<br /><br /> Me telling you you’d look perfect in heels.<br /><br /> With you not a single moment is dull,<br /><br /> My one and only partner in operations patrol.<br /><br /> Climbing tall buildings and spying on things,<br /><br /> Are just some of the stuff we can still do this spring.<br /><br /> I very much enjoyed our trip before break;<br /><br /> I’m pleased that you were able to partake.<br /><br /> Waiting for TWICE tickets down at the mall,<br /><br /> and pictures at Six Flags in the midst of it all.<br /><br /> And all sorts of other activities and sights;<br /><br /> I especially liked talking outside those nights.<br /><br /> I know we did some things quite out of order,<br /><br /> But there aren’t any changes I’d make to this quarter.<br /><br /> Being with you has been such a treat,<br /><br /> It’s so lovely to have a girlfriend this sweet.<br /><br /> I suppose we’re reaching the end of my tale,<br /><br /> For now together we begin to set sail.<br /><br /> To Monterey and Universal, or Seoul or NY,<br /><br /> (The ship is metaphorical, we’ll probably just fly.)<br /><br /> I’m so glad you’re with me to explore;<br /><br /> There’s so much to see, and things to do galore.<br /><br /> And though there are so many memories to come,<br /><br /> I’ll always treasure the things we have done.<br /><br /> For now I just wait for tomorrow and then,<br /><br /> A few more long days and I’ll see you again.<br /><br /> I always knew that for you I’d fall;<br /><br /> Merry Christmas to you, my most precious of all.<br /><br /></p>
