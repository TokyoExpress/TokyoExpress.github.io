		<h1>A Less Brief Birthday Note</h1>
		<h3>For Ari Kim</h3>
    <p>Happy birthday, my love!</p>
    <p>It is my hope that you not only have a great birthday but a great year, filled with just enough memories and good times until it’s time to celebrate you once more. Although you’ve heard me say this an an excuse multiple times over the years, it is true - birthdays are not particularly my strong suit. Of course, I don’t hope to carry this trait forward into the future, but as I was planning out how to celebrate your birthday this year, I took some time to think about what the significance of a birthday is, as well as how to show my appreciation for you from afar. </p>
    <p>I suppose it starts with some impatience on my part - for a while I have subscribed to the idea that any desire that one has need not wait for any particular event to be fulfilled. Gifts can be given at any time, the easiest and most obvious time being as soon as possible after the desire is displayed. Similarly, anything that I or you want to do can be done tomorrow, or next weekend, or the month after. I struggled to think of something that would be special or eventful enough to live up to the significance of your birthday. In my mind, your birthday is best suited for an expensive dinner somewhere that we would never go normally, or a lavish trip to Europe, or something else that would make the day itself really grand and memorable. After all, if the activities on your birthday could be rivaled by any other day in the year, what would the point of it be?</p>
    <p>But when I think about you and the way you celebrate me, I realize that I probably shouldn’t be thinking about it like this. I still vividly remember my birthday two years ago, right before I moved to Washington, when you DoorDashed me a slice of cake in the evening. I finished it at the dinner table at home within a few minutes, but to this day it reminds me of how sweet and caring of a person you are - not because of a sheer amount of sacrifice or effort but, just because you think of me and you notice me. I can feel so much love from you and I am so, so grateful. Even if all we did was go to Harris Teeter and buy half of a lemon cake for the next fifty years, I think I would still look forward to it each and every single time, because I don’t feel alone when I’m with you. And I think I am realizing that these are the most important things, to feel seen and to have genuine company.</p>
    <p>So although I won’t be able to provide you the latter on this very day, I hope this message is warm and reminds you that I care about you. The number of times I think about you each and every single day has become so normal to me that I often forget how wonderful it really is to have someone to look forward to and celebrate and share my life with. I think about how far we’ve come and all the different stages we’ve gone through and I just am so happy that I found you along the way. The person you were, the person you are, and the person you will be - I cannot imagine who I would be and who I will be if you are not by my side. I will always appreciate the way you love me and look out for me, and it fills me with happiness to think that we will be able to live life together in the future and share not only the grand adventures but the quiet everyday moments that make up the most of our time. As long as we are apart, I will always be waiting for the next time I see you. You add color and warmth to my life and I hope I can continue to make you as happy as you make me.</p>
    <p>Even with these nice words, though, in many ways it nevertheless remains true - your birthday remains not too different from any other day. I will be thinking of you often and wishing that you are feeling okay and in a good mood, and I will spend the time and the effort to show you that I care about you and want to be with you. But I don’t think this diminishes the importance of your birthday. Rather, I think that this is a testament to the fact that every day with you is already amazing and wonderful in more ways than I can imagine, and a reminder to myself that I should be grateful that I have this dilemma and opportunity in the first place: to have a difficult time conjuring up plans that will, in my mind, live up to how perfect and spectacular you are to me. And even if I don’t come up with the best gifts or activities every single time, I hope you know that you are always in my heart, and I will never stop trying to show you that you are truly special to me.</p>
    <p>And since it’s your birthday and I won’t see you for a couple weeks, I will let you know what your gift is. But don’t expect this to be an every time thing - I have not given up on making you appreciate surprises.</p>
    <p>I love you, and happy birthday.</p>
    <p>- Sam</p>
