		<h1>A Matter of Good Taste</h1>
		<h3>September 2016</h3>
		<p> One of the greatest developments of the 21st century in terms of intellectual warfare has been the rise of the self-named “waifu wars”, in which fans of Japanese animation fearlessly proclaimed their love for a specific 2D character in each show, hoping they will attain the coveted position known as “best girl1”. In some cases, there really is no contest, as one character is just objectively better than all the rest (e.g. Maki Nishikino from Love Live! School Idol Project2). Perhaps the most well-known of these battles of true strength and character is the feud between Kosaki Onodera fans and Chitoge Kirisaki fans in the anime adaption of the Shonen Jump manga Nisekoi (lit. “False Love”), by Naoshi Komi. This romantic comedy, a 229-chapter battle for the heart of dense and unobservant main character Raku Ichijou, features the classic pair of rivals: the shy, sweet childhood friend and the flashy, tough blonde transfer student. The romantic conquests are further enhanced by the existence of a “promise locket” and several keys from Raku and a forgotten girl that he had promised to marry during his childhood. But this debate is not simply a childish issue of popular culture, as each preferred heroine dictates not only a matter of good taste, but an objective stance on the practicality and attractiveness of a real life partner. Although Chitoge does end up marrying Raku in the end and is the de facto winner of the manga romance, Onodera is objectively a better heroine and deserves unending respect for her ideal traits as a girlfriend and significant other, her useful and endearing skills as a housewife and partner, and ultimately her significantly greater emotional attachment and precedental relevance as a character.<br /><br />

 Nisekoi ended in mid-2016 with a fairly conclusive ending, but that has not deterred fans from continuing to rage war throughout society. Chitoge fans have always taunted Onodera fans with their success in the canon storyline, as well as the fact that Onodera baked the wedding cake for the couple (which should not even be considered a loss but a showcase of Onodera’s fantastical ability to bake, one of the many basic skills that Chitoge lacks). However, the fact that Chitoge wins the Raku Bowl3 does not immediately grant her the status of “best girl” for the simple reason that it is irrelevant. The story as it unravels in the story is purely a result of the author’s intent to have the transfer student win as usual, and in no way reflects the actual hierarchy of the heroines. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that Raku would have had just as happy a romance with his childhood friend Onodera, had the circumstances been slightly different. Raku even admits that somewhere along the line he “realized that [he] like[d] two people” (Komi, Chapter 200). Ignoring the extreme denseness of our main character displayed in this statement alone, we can use this line to accurately determine that Raku harbors strong feelings for both heroines, rendering any romantic outcome wholly a result of chance and situational events. Additionally, Raku ends up determining his first choice based on a piece of advice from his friend, Shuu: “Those small things in everyday life. When you encounter those small happiness or luck, who is the very first person you want to tell that to? Whose face came into your mind?” (Komi 217). While this is an endearing question and a touching aspect of the manga, logic would follow that the answer to this question would be the person he spent the most time with, which just so happened to be Chitoge based on the events of the story. Altogether, Chitoge’s victory in Nisekoi is not a true advantage but rather a strawman argument, as it provides no real grounds as to which character is truly better.<br /><br />

 When it comes to attractiveness, Onodera completely outclasses Chitoge in almost every aspect. While some may argue that the physical attractiveness of human beings in general is a matter of personal perspective, it is really just a matter of various categories: cute, “hot”, elegant, etc. Onodera is obviously cuter than Chitoge based on looks alone; that is an indisputable fact. But there is really no way of proving which character is innately more physically attractive as a whole. However, there are key differences in how they put themselves together. Onodera’s unique hairstyle is beloved by all and instantly recognizable, while Chitoge relies on her signature red ribbon in order to differentiate herself from the other cookie-cutter blonde heroines. In terms of fashion and clothing, they both wear the same uniform, so there’s nothing to really compare here. They wear similar outdoors clothing, and it really cannot be used as a basis of comparison. However, the attractiveness of a character is based not only on physical appearance but on mannerisms and personality, categories in which Onodera very clearly is superior in. Onodera exhibits a sweet, caring attitude constantly, which pairs perfectly with her tendency to be shy and embarrassed to create the ideal incarnation of a cute girlfriend. She often looks out for the well-being of others, as shown multiple times when she takes care of an injured or sick Raku. Meanwhile, Chitoge constantly abuses Raku and is in general a very high-maintenance character, always requiring special errands or tasks to be completed for her own personal benefit. She also employs the use of vulgar language and direct insults as a part of her vernacular arsenal, as shown from the beginning where she writes a note to Raku stating “don’t talk to me anymore scum bastard!!!” (Komi 1). While some may argue that this is a classic case of “tsundere”, a Japanese term for one who is cold and hostile towards someone that they are actually romantically interested again, the truth is that Chitoge is just not as friendly and approachable a person as Onodera is. Her label as a “tsundere” not only confirms her vicious and destructive nature, but further amplifies the argument that she is nothing more than a bundle of common tropes put together with no real unique personality of her own. Even if she somehow surpassed Onodera in terms of physical attractiveness, there is no denying that she is vastly flawed in her personality. Raku himself states that “the worst part of her is what she says” (Komi 1). Chitoge is far less attractive than Onodera as a potential girlfriend, and no sane person would willingly endure the torture and suffering associated with dating Chitoge when offered the alternative of the pure cinnamon bun of love that is Kosaki Onodera.<br /><br />

 When searching for a potential mate, it is also important to take note of their practical aspects and skills. No one wants a partner who is unwilling to do their part to potentially support a family and foster a healthy, working relationship. Coming from a family of pastry chefs, Onodera is already well-versed in the art of decorating various cakes and candies, and has a meaningful and useful career lined up ahead of her as she inherits her family’s shop. Meanwhile, Chitoge ends up becoming a fashion designer, a career that requires much traveling and offers no free time to take care of a family. Chitoge also can’t cook either. How is she supposed to take care of a family if she is unable to provide basic necessities for her children? On the other hand, Onodera is capable of producing both delicious and artfully crafted food, just not at the same time. Her caring temperament and sweet personality will provide a nurturing and warm environment to raise a family, while Chitoge’s large absences due to career and hotheaded temper will only serve to teach her children wrong. Many Chitoge fans criticize Onodera’s lack of high intelligence and praise Chitoge’s ability to rank highly in school. However, it must be noted that while Chitoge does consistently obtain good grades, she does not even try to study, relying solely on her innate natural talent to succeed. Onodera, while not as smart, makes a genuine effort to learn and achieve, even making new friends in the process. This stark contrast between laziness and motivation proves another startling difference between the two heroines, one that further emphasizes Onodera’s ability to survive on her own, while Chitoge almost always relies on the people around her(e.g. Raku and her bodyguard, Tsugumi) in order to make it through everyday life. This type of happy-go-lucky and burdensome attitude will eventually lead to a stressful and unhappy relationship, something to be avoided at all costs. Ultimately, Onodera’s skills and personality traits make for a much stronger and long-lasting relationship and marriage that is capable of properly equipping their next generation and future posterity.<br /><br />

 Finally, Onodera is simply a more relevant character than Chitoge will ever be. Sure, Chitoge may be Raku’s wife and may have a playable character model in Super Mario Maker4, but she very clearly is not very memorable apart from her signature red ribbon. Onodera is the main character of her own spinoff series, Magical Patissier Kosaki-chan5, which has received critical acclaim for its artful depictions of the one true best girl. Chitoge does not have her own spinoff manga series and is basically a joke character in Patissier, because no one is really interested in seeing more content of her. Even in the official Shonen Jump polls6, Onodera received over 500 more total votes than Chitoge, crowning her the well-deserved fan favorite she is. But most importantly, in the canon storyline, Kosaki is the original promise girl that Raku confesses to and agrees to marry in the beginning. Although Raku eventually turns into a blind loser who picks the wrong girl, even he understands that “if I could stay next to her always then I’d be happy” (Komi 226). Her status as the promise girl holds true for not only the characters in the story, but all readers and fans of Nisekoi: she will always be something special to all who are able to understand how truly great of a character she is. Onodera supporters are loyal to the cause, stronger in numbers, and have better taste than our blond-loving counterparts. While Chitoge fans are always looking for the next boring, blond, tsundere half-American half-Japanese transfer student to dote over, there is no real replacement for Onodera. She leaves an impact on the reader; she is remembered emotionally and spiritually. She is the essence of the perfect girlfriend, wife, partner, companion, individual, and everything in between. She, unlike Chitoge, will never be forgotten, no matter how the years may come.<br /><br />

 For the majority of this dissertation, you may have been wondering: what’s the point? Why should I care about some two-dimensional animated girls in some Japanese TV show? But this is not just about the long-lasting rivalry between two fanbases, nor is it about two specific characters in a manga magazine for young boys. Recognizing Onodera’s superiority to Chitoge is about having good taste, the ability to make proper, informed decisions concerning future romantic pursuits. One cannot simply be content with having the bundle of tropes, the cliche character that just doesn’t hold up in the end. Not only does Onodera’s attractiveness represent who she is as a character in all aspects, but it is a symbol, a representation of what everyone should strive to look for in a soulmate. Just good looks or a nice personality will not do, rather, it must be a coherently round individual, a living incarnation of treasure. It is not right to simply settle for the Chitoges of the world, the poorly written, irrelevant, abusive characters that aren’t worth even the slightest of thoughts after their story is over. Instead, always be on the lookout for the Onoderas, the best girls, the caring ones, the endearingly clumsy events, the signature lock of brown hair that falls off the left side of the head at just the right angle. Be sure to see the full picture, to analyze what a person truly means to you in the grand scale of things. Even if your Onodera doesn’t actually own a candy shop, it is recognizing and holding onto the special things in life that just make it that much sweeter.<br /><br />

Appendix<br /><br />

1: It is important to distinguish between a “best girl” and a “waifu”. You can select a best girl for each individual show, but you can only have one waifu. More than one waifu will destroy your laifu.<br /><br />

2: Love Live! School Idol Project is a Japanese anime about nine girls who form a singing group together. There is often much debate about which one is the best, but the majority of the fanbase will tell you that it is Maki.<br /><br />

3: Waifu wars are commonly named “___ Bowl” in which the blank is filled with either the show name or the main character’s name, as if they are competing in a tournament. In this case, the Raku Ichijou Bowl.<br /><br />

4: Super Mario Maker is a globally popular game in the Mario series by Nintendo Games.<br /><br />

5: Patissier was drawn by a different artist, and has a completely different plot than the original, featuring supernatural magical girls and other outlandish premises. It was mostly meant as a joke to supplement the original manga.<br /><br />

6: The Shonen Jump polls are periodical surveys that readers can vote in and pick their favorite character out of.<br /><br />
