		<h2>January 7, 2024</h2>
		<h1>Speedrunning, Part 2</h1>
		<h3>6:15 AM</h3>
		<p>This year I received a LEGO set from my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. It’s a Tallneck from Horizon: Zero Dawn, one of the best games I played in 2023. I built the first couple of sections earlier tonight.<br /><br />

It’s been quite a while since I’ve done a full size LEGO set, but I remember I always used to just blaze through them in a few hours. I loved building LEGOs (and I’m glad to discover that I still do), so whenever my parents and I got back from the store with one I would open it up and try to finish it in the same day. It was one of the best ways to spend the afternoon as a kid, and I can’t say it was ever a bad experience to go from start to finish in one sitting. Nowadays, however, I feel like things are a bit different. The previous counterpart to this post was written about three and a half years ago, when I was in college. Even then, I feel like my priorities were already shifting to be more career-oriented and long-term. One of the things I miss the most about childhood was the ability to just waste the day away without feeling any remorse - any time having fun was time well spent.<br /><br />

I don’t think that adults can’t have fun anymore, but I will say it is very different now. Even though I’m only in my early twenties, I feel like people are becoming more and more driven and ambitious, for better or for worse. There are now “good” and “bad” ways to have fun. Going out to a museum with friends is “good”: educational, social, and explorative. Playing your favorite video game for nine hours could be “bad”: repetitive, sedentary, and unambitious. And sure, I’m part of the problem, too. It’d take someone more open-minded (or naive) than me to tell you that that was a perfectly good use of your time.<br /><br />

Like all things in life, I feel like there has to be a balance. As a child, I was free to spend an unlimited amount of time indulging in simple pleasures and instant gratification, whether that was with toys, computers, food, or anything else. There just wasn’t really anything else that seemed to be more important. And although it was a very enjoyable time, there’s something about hard work and meaningful progress that provides a much needed purpose for many people, myself included. Ambition doesn’t just keep you busy: it gives you a much-needed passion to apply yourself. Completing a long personal project or watching yourself substantially improve is rewarding in a way that seems to be more meaningful than your everyday mean of comfort and entertainment.<br /><br />

But in the same vein, it’d be foolish to say that those lesser rewards aren’t worth doing. A life without ambition can become monotonous and unfulfilling, but a life without those simple satisfactions can become filled with anxiety and burnout. One should have a healthy amount of both types in order to lead a pleasant and interesting lifestyle.<br /><br />

And sure, some of you might already be fully on board with this. I would like to say that I am too, but I just am not there yet. I can’t shake the idea that I would be able to reach greater heights and higher success if I simply cut out all the lazy Saturdays and after-work gaming sessions. Sometimes I actively try to speed through the last parts of games or TV shows I’m really having a good time with, because after a week of spending a couple hours a day on it, I begin to feel like I need to wrap it up and get back to my normal life of grinding projects and improving my skills.<br /><br />

Which, to be honest - is not all that much more productive. Without something to explicitly occupy those few hours of my day, I’d likely spend it on something even more brainless, maybe watching YouTube or scrolling Reddit to fill in that time. But because I’m not having a particularly good time doing those activities, it doesn’t make me feel as guilty - I suppose I have an aversion to the things that I really enjoy. Perhaps I think they are traps that I need to avoid if I want to truly make progress on my life.<br /><br />

The elusive progress. I’m not really sure what it is. For a while I thought it was making more money and growing my wealth to a point where I’m able to support a family and live a relatively comfortable life, but now that I am actually somewhat heading towards that trajectory, it seems to be more than that. It’s a strange abstract concept, some sort of amalgamation of hope, fiery ambition, and some distant goal of being one of “the greats” - someone rich and famous maybe, or having created or contributed something worth remembering. And even if I did manage to achieve one of those legendary feats, would I be done? Would I breathe a sigh of relief after all these years and bask in the afterglow for the rest of my days? I’m really not sure, and because I’m not sure, I have to find out. I have to keep going in the hopes that I might one day be able to put everything all down, finally free of the eternal climb.<br /><br />

I know I don’t really have to. Or at least I hope I do. But somewhere deep inside, I am not letting go. I think that although I do want to be, I am not really content. To me, saying that it’s okay to live out my life as a somewhat ordinary person, not known by most people on this earth, with no Wikipedia entry or seven figure net worth, is the same as saying that I won’t ever achieve any of those things. And not just that I won’t - that I <i>can’t</i>. I guess I always believed I was special, or destined for greatness, or something like that. Those thoughts gave me the motivation to pursue lofty goals and push myself higher, but I think somewhere along the way I stopped having fun with what I was actually doing. I enjoy my hobbies and projects, but part of me just likes the idea of being good at things in general, and not just good, but better and smarter and faster than other people, for some reason. I suppose that when I was growing up in that competitive Bay Area pressure-cooker environment, it felt so good to be part of the elites, to be praised and complimented and told that you were definitely going places, that you were going to be one the top students, or workers, or anything for that matter. I think that as much as I’ve tried to distance myself from that type of mindset, some part of it remains in the core of my personality and who I am, as if I was shaped by it.<br /><br />

But I’d like to be someone different, at least in that aspect. I hope I can get to a point where I am truly partaking in my hobbies - playing guitar, designing logos and wooden boxes and various little contraptions, cooking, playing single-player games, etc. - because I like doing those things, and I enjoy the time spent doing those activities. More often than not these days I find myself putting some arbitrary goals in the distant future for myself, something about being well known for my skills, my creations becoming popular among the general public, things like that. I spend so much time wanting those things, and wanting them now, that I cannot bear to just sit down and practice and spend an hour improving ever so slightly, because it’s just too slow. And I wish I didn’t do that. I wish I didn’t actually care about those types of things, because they seem outlandish and far-fetched. But you have to keep going, I tell myself. If you lose this mindset, you will lose your edge, and you will fall behind. Things like that. And honestly, like I said before, for someone who thinks about these themes of progress and ambition and achievement and the like, I actually get so little done. That’s probably the most frustrating part.<br /><br />

When I was younger I was always curious why home renovation and remodeling projects took so long. I would hear about how building a deck or remodeling a bathroom would take 6 months to a year, and I would wonder how on Earth anyone could take so long to finish a project. Wouldn’t they get impatient and want the results now, and just keep working every day until it was finished? But now I know. Life just gets in the way. And maybe that’s not just a lesson in patience and a hard pill to swallow, but a reflection of the balance and gentleness of life. Some things, like your run-of-the-mill errands, grocery shopping, emails and the like, can be over in an afternoon - they just aren’t meant to last more than a day. Some things, like my never-ending side quests, seem to never move at all, so slow that you can never seem to catch it. They go up and down and around in circles for years and years and you just can’t hope to ever see the end of it, if it even exists. And sometimes, you get a choice. You stumble upon a little project or activity that just has the right amount of permanence - a week if you spend a couple hours a day on it, a month if you’re busier, maybe even longer. I think that for as long as I’ve been alive, I’ve always inclined to just go full speed ahead. The faster you go, the faster you can get to the result, the reward! I guess I never really stopped to wonder if there was another way of thinking.<br /><br />

My girlfriend loves to do puzzles - her family will sometimes just leave a puzzle on the living room table for a couple of weeks. People will devote a few minutes or an hour here and there as they come and go, and eventually the puzzle would be completed. It’ll sit on the table for all to admire for a little while, and then back in the box it goes. A new puzzle will show up sometime after.<br /><br />

I guess for someone like me, who doesn’t even really like puzzles in the first place, it would be easy to write this off - you wait an absurd amount of time to see a big picture, and then after a while the picture gets destroyed again, so you basically just did it all for nothing. And then you do it again and again. Seems monotonous and meaningless. And therein lies the flaw of my thinking: I only care about the end result. For a lot of my hobbies, I’ve carried this mentality - I want to get better at woodworking so I can make this table, or I want to master this one song on guitar so I have one more thing I can play. My creative endeavors can be summed up with the various projects I’ve finished, or the entities I’ve created, whether they be meals, designs, stickers, shirts, songs, boxes, or something else. Those are what I have to show, and those are all that matter to me.<br /><br />

I’d like to change that, and I’d like to go beyond this short-sighted line of thinking. I feel like I am overly focused on this idea of “life experience” - just getting more things under my belt, whether that’s a video game finished or a project completed or something else. And I realize now why people leave puzzles on the table or remodel a basement over the course of a year (other than the time commitments in between) - there’s value in the actions themselves, whether they are fulfilling, challenging, or just plain relaxing. I’ve lost the appreciation for the actual time spent doing things, and I’m hoping to learn to prioritize them over the distant results and end products that I’ve spent so much time obsessing over.<br /><br />

And you may be thinking that this is incredibly obvious, but there are just some things that take a lifetime to unlearn. And for someone who’s never taken more than a day to complete a LEGO set, it’s quite strange to have one sitting on the living room unfinished, waiting for me to come back and make progress on it again. But I’d like to teach myself to slow down and be okay with things not moving at light speed. It’s okay to have the set completed in a couple of weeks, and have a little more time in the middle of it. Every time I sit down to work on it, I’ll try to remember that it’s okay to enjoy the building process, to drag it out and let it progress ever so slowly. And of course there will be exceptions. I have a fish tank that I’ve been “setting up” for three months or so now, and I can't say I've been very expeditious with working towards its completion. And I’m sure there will be projects in the future where it's the opposite, where I spend every moment thinking about or working on it and I just can’t sleep until I’ve finished. All of these are okay: the marathon or the sprint. But no matter what distance or how long you’re going for, I think everyone can agree that it becomes a hell of a lot easier, even pleasant maybe, if you actually enjoy the running.<br /><br />

I’m still working on being content with whatever future is in store for me. Part of me still wants to know if it’s possible to go higher and higher, and reach those earthly treasures of wealth and fame, even though I know in my heart that it’s all meaningless. I guess I just want to keep myself busy, and keep running towards some ethereal, unattainable object in the skies. And it’s going to take me a little while to accept it, but I know that even if none of it ever happens, and I spend the rest of my days living an “ordinary” life, that it will be incredible, beyond my wildest dreams, and worth more than any material thing on this planet. I am, and always have been, as you all are, destined for greatness.<br /><br />

I just have to keep reminding myself that there is more to it all than just the finish line.</p>
