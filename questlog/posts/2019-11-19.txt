Note 12/22/19: This was written on a Google Doc while I was getting the website set up. I guess we're just going to write in here until we can get our flagship site running and up in the air. To make that happen, I'm currently learning HTML and CSS in my free time. Hopefully I'll learn enough of that and maybe Brackets and Dreamweaver to turn my domain into an actually serviceable site.

I've realized that although I originally intended for this document to be one of my organization ones where I tried to set my priorities and write out tasks that I had to complete, it is now looking more like a diary or developer journal of sorts. Which is ok, I suppose. I could always just write stuff to do in the bottom of the page and delete it as time goes on. Yeah, I'm going to do that.

I think the last time that I really sat down and just tried to learn something from scratch was the summer of 2018 when I spent two or three months just grinding on GameMaker trying to do a project (with the exception of blender over summer 2019 which I still don't really know how to use). That was fun but also frustrating. Luckily HTML/CSS is mostly design, so I won't be running around trying to catch runtime errors for hours on end.
I'll report more on the life side of things in the next one.
