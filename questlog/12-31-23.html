		<h1>Pivot Points, Part 2</h1>
		<h3>1:23 PM</h3>
		<p>It’s been about 9 months since my last post, and I cannot for the life of me remember why it was titled “Pivot Points”. It seems my witty abstract naming habits have caught up to me - not that I’m going to stop spending an absurd amount of time coming up with these titles and themes, though. That’s half the reason I still write these things.<br /><br />

Things have changed once again. I’ve managed to escape my previous predicament, and have since left San Francisco. My new job has brought me to the city of Washington, D.C., where I’ve been for the past three months or so. It’s my first time living outside of California and the farthest I’ve been from home in a little while. I’m now getting used to a new role in a larger company, a unfamiliar and cold (literally) city, and dealing with the aftermath of prolonged exposure to a toxic work environment. Not going to make that the main point of this post, but it was quite a harrowing time of my life. I don’t wish it upon anyone.<br /><br />

Now that I’ve restored some semblance of normalcy to my life, the usual stuff has started to come back: late night thoughts about existentialism and the purpose and trajectory of my life, semi-creative endeavors in my free time, and, albeit returning rather slowly, the adventurous spirit. I can’t say I missed lying awake at night with random introspective thoughts running through my head, but it definitely feels more like myself again. I’ve been trying to pick up my hobbies again as well - for the past year or so I couldn’t bring myself to actually do anything with heart.<br /><br />

To be honest, it’s been a bit difficult to write recently, as it has been to do most of my creative hobbies. My attention span has gotten very short for some reason, and I often find myself doing something for only one or two minutes before clicking away and doing something more low effort like scrolling through Reddit. I’m not entirely sure why. Perhaps it’s because I still am expecting something to be achieved through my hobbies, and that idea of productivity is draining. I’m able to complete most errands without breaking focus, though, so it’s a bit strange. Maybe this is due to the fact that most errands can be concretely completed within a certain timeframe, so the gratification aspect of it makes it much more bearable. But no matter the reason, this situation is unideal. I seem to have developed a poor relationship with the hobbies that were supposed to bring me satisfaction and pleasure in my free time. I think I will try to reconcile this in the near future.<br /><br />

As for the transient aspect of life that I brought up previously, I have actually moved to an even more transient location. Washington is notoriously a city where people move in and out of for work (particularly in the political sphere) - lending itself to a wide variety of types of people. It’s been refreshing to not be surrounded by the Silicon Valley tech atmosphere everywhere I go, but I can’t say I’ve made much an effort to plant myself in this area. I still feel as if everything is temporary - even though I know it might end up being a couple years or more. I find myself just going on autopilot, letting the days go by, and subconsciously waiting for the next phase of life to come and take me away. The reasons for that are… well, complicated, but I’d also like to gravitate towards living in the moment and truly making the most out of my time here.<br /><br />

I’ll just end it off here. This post is a bit more real and personal, for better or for worse. I do hope to continue making more abstract and thematic posts in the future.</p>
