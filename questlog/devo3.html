		<h2>Works</h2>
		<h1>#3: Uncertainty</h1>
		<h3>February 2019</h3>
		<p>There are no coincidences. Look around.<br /><br />
For truth feeds into commitment, and commitment is a declaration of further belief.<br /><br />
And another truth remains imminent: our all-loving and all-powerful Father works in our lives every second of every day.<br /><br />
And if we remain committed to this belief, then it must be true that any and all situations are part of a catalyst and a journey to bring Him more glory.<br /><br />
Yes, sometimes it does not make sense.<br /><br />
Sometimes it seems like there is absolutely no reason for this.<br /><br />
But remain stouthearted, o ye of little faith.<br /><br />
Do you not believe in the power of the Lord?<br /><br />
Do you not trust in the plans of the God Almighty?<br /><br />
For uncertainty resides with darkness, although in a slightly different manner.<br /><br />
Uncertainty in the world is natural. For who can know the future or predict the rest of their life?<br /><br />
If we were not uncertain about the rest of each day, I am convinced that a large amount of fear and worry would cease to exist.<br /><br />
And if we were not uncertain about the rest of each day, how much less effective would the Spirit be at providing You with spontaneous truths and opportunities?<br /><br />
For no eye has seen and no ear has heard what the Lord God has prepared for each and every one of us.<br /><br />
The Lord has promised great plans for His children.<br /><br />
But even so, it is not our responsibility to play prophet, or to try to determine God's plan for us.<br /><br />
Life is but a journey with one destination in the Father. All else is but part of this journey.<br /><br />
And so I remain uncertain about the world and its events, in order for God's glory and revelation to be even more of a pleasing surprise.<br /><br />
But uncertainty in the Father is a different matter.<br /><br />
Uncertainty in the Lord is doubt, and doubt is with the darkness.<br /><br />
If I proclaim belief in Christ but do not hand over my life to Him, I am a cheat and a liar.<br /><br />
If I proclaim Christ as the captain of my soul but refuse to trust Him, I am a coward.<br /><br />
Though I remain uncertain of the workings of this world, I must remain steadfast in the one truth: that all will turn out as it should be.<br /><br />
For there is no power on this Earth that can take me off the journey that the Lord has planned for me.<br /><br />
Especially not my own incompetence and unworthiness.<br /><br />
For Christ has made me a new creation in Him, and I am bound eternally to His fatherhood.<br /><br />
He is with me.<br /><br />
So there are no coincidences. Look around.<br /><br />
Uncertainty remains in the world, but in Christ there is everlasting hope.<br /><br />
So hold on, my friends.<br /><br />
Your faith will surely be rewarded soon.<br /><br />
If not now, then later.<br /><br />
If not later, then even later.<br /><br />
But trust that it will happen.<br /><br />
For this is the truth, and it will always remain.<br /><br />
