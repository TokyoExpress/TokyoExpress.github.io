		<p>“Did you hear what I just said?”<br /><br />

 I didn’t.<br /><br />

“Are you serious? You spaced out again?”<br /><br />

To call it spacing out is a bit of a misunderstanding. Normally, when people ‘space out,’ there’s nothing on their minds. But it seems that I always have something to think about. Maybe it’s a test I’m having tomorrow, or that model I wanted to buy at the hobby shop. Either way, it’s far too easy to get distracted.<br /><br />

“Yeah, sorry. What were you saying?”<br /><br />

I’ve gotten used to lying by now. A casual lie saves us both some trouble, and saves her an emotional breakdown. Avoiding the situation at hand is the best choice, even if we both know the truth.<br /><br />

“I’m just really tired, I guess. How much longer do they expect me to put up with this?”<br /><br />

I’m not even sure if those were her exact words. After all, I’ve heard them so many times before, just in a different order. It’s more or less the same conversation every time. I can hardly even call it a conversation, really. Conversations require more than one active participant.<br /><br />

“Anyways, it’s getting late. I have to go now. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Bye!”<br /><br />

Click. And with that, she’s gone. I don’t know whether I’m relieved or worried. She’s always cared about the things that made no sense to me. In the end, it doesn’t really matter, does it? It’s not like my personal emotions can somehow affect her life in any way, even if I decide to express them in some sort.<br /><br />

I remember the first time she pointed that out to me. It was in the seventh grade, when she had just been rejected by this tall blonde boy in the grade above.<br /><br />

“So what if you’re sad for me? It doesn’t change anything, you know.”<br /><br />

Of course she didn’t mean it like that, and she later apologized, as expected. But she did have a point. Words really do have no significance for a fairly large fraction of situations, especially if I was just making things up to make her feel better. I couldn’t really understand why she was sad in the first place.<br /><br />

I open my room door as quietly as possible to check on my dorm mates. Hearing a couple murmurs of acknowledgement, I give a small wave before retreating back in and continuing to work.<br /><br />

It seems I can never run out of work. People say to find something you’re passionate about, and you’ll never truly be working. But I’ve found that the things that are enjoyable to me end up requiring the most amount of work. Perhaps it’s because I don’t get to give up early on.<br /><br />

An hour later, my phone rings again. I don’t really have to check who it is, since it’s a custom ringtone: her favorite song.<br /><br />

Twice in the same day. That’s odd.<br /><br />

She first discovered the song a while back, and proceeded to listen to it non-stop for the next two months. When I asked her what she liked about it so much, her response was:<br /><br />

“I don’t know; it’s just good. There’s not really a specific reason. Like, why do you like your favorite color?”<br /><br />

I don’t actually have a favorite color, so I couldn’t answer. Her favorite color is magenta, but there is a reason for that one. Although, at the time, she probably didn’t realize it yet.<br /><br />

A custom ringtone is not very useful when it's the only one I ever hear. It might as well be the default one. And unlike her, I don't really like this song. Specifically, the melody isn't very catchy and the instrumentation isn't as upbeat as I'd prefer it to be. But it's not exactly a good use of time to be concerned about these sorts of things.<br /><br />

“It happened again. I thought it was going to be fine, but it wasn't. I don't know what to do anymore.”<br /><br />

In situations like these, normally a simple “that sucks” or “I'm sorry” would take care of this instantly. But even as little as I care about her problems, I care about her too much to stoop to that level of surface fulfillment. After all, we are supposed to be friends.<br /><br />

“We’re friends, right?” she’d asked me late one night, several years ago.<br /><br />

“Huh? Yeah, I guess.”<br /><br />

And we never talked about it ever again.<br /><br /></p>

	<p>I've always been told that I care too much.<br /><br />

When I got a C on my AP Chemistry midterm back in my junior year of high school, I didn't talk to anyone for a while. I felt like it was the end of the world for me. This was partially influenced by my poor experience of a childhood, which was mostly spent getting called a worthless piece of trash by my parents.<br /><br />

I lived in a generally friendly neighborhood, so whenever I got angry I would go outside and sit on the front lawn for a few hours. By the time I got up I would have grass stains all the way down the back of my skirt, but it was worth it.<br /><br />

I think I was about four or five when he first talked to me. A fairly tall black-haired boy had caught me right in the middle of one of my lawn-sitting sessions.<br /><br />

“You know, you're going to get grass all over your clothes if you do that,” he'd said. It wasn't the nicest thing to say to someone, but it wasn't inaccurate. Which, now that I think about it, aptly describes everything he’s ever said.<br /><br />

He was eccentric, to say the least, but not in a quirky way. We both understood how each other worked, even though we were so different. And unlike many people I met over the years, he’d always found a way to make things better, such as when Bryce Cameron publicly refused to go to the school dance with me in the middle of the quad, right in front of my group of four friends and class of two hundred.<br /><br />

“Yeah, I know that what I say or think doesn’t really change anything. But isn’t that the point? You’re allowed to be sad when stuff like this happens. It’s not like you always have to be OK.”<br /><br />

Somehow, that made me feel better than the thousand “I’m so sorry”s I got from my friends.<br /><br />

But as I grew up, my problems became a lot more significant than some boy in middle school. My parents got divorced when I was in tenth grade, and I would spend a lot of time just listening to them yelling at each other over the phone. It didn’t help that I would live in different houses depending on the day of the week. It was near impossible to stay sane. My ears would be filled with nothing but screaming for days on end, whether it was directed at me or not.<br /><br />

 So when I received that fateful 70% on my exam, I’d already been having a pretty stressful week. I knew it was just a test, but it was the last straw for me. It didn’t really matter that my dad threw the phone book at me for it, or that my friends called me petty for dampening the mood with my sadness. To be honest, I’d never worried too much about what others thought. But I had actually studied hard for that one. I’d tried, and I’d failed. And it hurts the most when the one you disappoint is yourself.<br /><br />

I found myself sitting on the lawn again. It was winter, and the grass was slightly tinged with slivers of ice. It was cold. But there was no way I was going to go back into that house. To me, this was far less suffering than the madness that was going on behind me.<br /><br />

Time seemed to come to a halt, as if the cold itself had gotten to it. The moon shined a brilliant white, reflected by the hundreds of ice blades at my feet. But I kept waiting. After all, if I waited long enough, someone would eventually save me.<br /><br />

At least I hoped.<br /><br />

 “You know, you’re going to get grass on yourself if you stay there.”<br /><br />

 I smiled faintly.<br /><br />

 “I know.”<br /><br /></p>

 <hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

 <p> She calls me once per day, always between 9:00 and 9:30 in the evening. They usually last around one hour, sometimes more. Sometimes less. For some reason, I started keeping track of the numbers around twenty calls in. I guess I thought it would be fun. But as I later came to find out, there’s nothing really fun at all about this situation.<br /><br />

 I honestly don’t mind, considering that it doesn’t require that much effort on my part. I just have to listen. No fluffed-up drama or meaningless comforting phrases. After all, that’s everything I can give her. A listening ear, and all the time in the world. She insists that just my presence is enough, but sometimes I can’t help but wish I could offer something more substantial. She’s given me so much, but all I can do is sit and listen.<br /><br />

 It’s unfair. But I’ve realized that this world does not exactly operate on fairness.<br /><br />

 This would have been the 493rd call.<br /><br />

 It’s 9:36.<br /><br /></p>

 <hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

 <p>In the summer of my senior year, we saw each other very little. Occasionally, I’d catch a glimpse of him leaving in the morning, but I never knew where he was going. We’d strike up random conversations from time to time, but nothing really stood out.<br /><br />

 “Hey, you’re going to Westside, right?”<br /><br />

 “Yeah.”<br /><br />

 “It’s out of state, right? Across the country, too.”<br /><br />

 “Yeah.”<br /><br />

 “Oh. Well, I’ll see you on the holidays, I guess.”<br /><br />

 “Yeah. I guess.”<br /><br />

 These were typically followed by a three-second silence, then a mutually tacit agreement to end the encounter right there. We were both doing alright, anyways. My dad had begun seeing someone else, and they spent more time looking into each other’s eyes than after me. I’d landed an internship at a large conglomerate firm as a financial analyst, and was going to take a gap year before going to college. Meanwhile, he was getting prepared to go to undergrad as a computer science major.<br /><br />

 “When are you leaving?”<br /><br />

 “Uh… August 27.”<br /><br />

 “Wait, that’s like next week. Are you serious?”<br /><br />

 “Yeah. Sorry.”<br /><br />

 I guess I hadn’t been keeping track of time too well. I knew I had to find a chance to say a proper goodbye. It was only when I was in the process of asking him when he was available that I realized how limited our interactions really were. Aside from our conversations in front of the houses, as frequent as they were, I’d never really spent any actual time with him. That thought made me feel like a pretty bad person, so I went ahead and asked my employer to give me the rest of the week off. It was for a good cause, I convinced myself. A small redemption of sorts.<br /><br />

 That’s how we found ourselves together on his porch one afternoon, with absolutely no idea what to do.

 It made sense. I was open to anything, while he didn’t really care for much. Eventually, we just decided to take a hike on a local mountain trail. Actually, I picked it for us. I don’t think he had ever hiked in his life.

 I’ll spare the details, since walking up a dusty road isn’t exactly the most vivid imagery to reflect on. But when we reached the top of that little hill, it was more than I’d ever expected to see in our small hometown.

 The sunset was a shimmering shade of pink and purple, stretching across the horizon and darting between the clouds. The light enveloped us both, and I could almost feel its direct warmth like a giant glowing hearth in the sky.<br /><br />

 “It’s my favorite color.”<br /><br />

 “This?”<br /><br />

 “Yeah, but I don’t know what it’s called.”<br /><br />

 “It’s magenta.”<br /><br />

 “Yeah. That one.”<br /><br />

 “Why?”<br /><br />

 “Because it’s beautiful.”<br /><br />

 I waited for his classic sarcastic reply, perhaps an explanation as to why that was stupid and that I should probably see a psychiatrist. Or how that wasn’t a real reason, or how it was illogical and therefore dumb. But I didn’t hear any of those. Instead, only one word came out of his mouth.<br /><br />

 “Oh.”<br /><br />

 I looked over. His eyes, filled with the mirror image of the breathtaking view, were mesmerized. At that moment I was certain that there was no one I’d rather spend this moment with. Just viewing his reaction to all that was happening was the highlight of my summer. Maybe even the highlight of my entire life. Every problem that I had ever stressed over, every detail of life that I had overthought all melted away in this culmination of tranquility and silence.<br /><br />

 He may not have said as many things as I’d liked him to say, or offered the best company when I was feeling down, but he was always there. And yet I was never able to help him with his struggles. Now I was looking into his eyes for the very last time before our lives went in different directions, and I had absolutely nothing to say. So, out of ideas, I asked perhaps the lamest question I could ever think of, hoping to reassure myself that we wouldn’t drift apart someday. If anything, it was just a poor attempt for me to define our relationship. The truth is, it was much more than just friendship. We were both intertwined in each other’s lives to the point where I honestly felt like he was going to be there with me forever. Unfortunately, wishful thinking is just thinking. It doesn’t make things happen or solve problems.<br /><br />

 I waited for his response. It took a bit of time for him to snap out of his sunset-induced trance, but he slowly caught up with reality. Then, he laughed. It was the first time I’d ever seen him genuinely smile.<br /><br />

“Yeah. I guess.”<br /><br />

 And that was all I needed to hear.<br /><br /></p>

  <hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

 <p> “Yeah, of course you don’t. Is there anything you actually care about?”<br /><br />

 Ever since I was a kid, I never really connected well with others. My parents died in a car accident when I was three years old, and I went through a lot of legal trouble to be able to live alone like I do now. People always assume that I’ve had some sort of psychological trauma from that, and that maybe that’s the reason for my constant apathy. But the truth is that I’ve always been this way. As hard as I try, I can’t really bring myself to feel strongly about most things. Talking to other people felt kind of strange, as if they were all on a different plane of reality than I was. They all seemed too absorbed in worrying about the small things, the useless regrets, than actually doing them. But even I knew that it wasn’t them that was odd.<br /><br />

 Raising yourself sounds pretty cool, but in reality it is a lot of work. I learned how to take care of myself, but I lost the free time that so many other of my peers had. In fact, I probably spent more time running errands and working on my own projects alone than I did with other kids my age. And yeah, I did end up getting a lot of work done. I made a lot of things, and I got good at several skills. I constantly tried new things. I played piano, learned how to code, tried drawing, photography, everything.<br /><br />

But I was alone.<br /><br />

I wouldn’t say I like being alone, nor would I say I hate it. Loneliness isn’t an emotion, or something you can control using your own willpower. It doesn’t matter if you’re happy or sad about it; if the world decides that you’re alone, there’s nothing you can do about it. Even if you are surrounded by people - people who care, genuine, wholesome people - you can still be alone. Being alone is not a choice. It’s just a destination.<br /><br />

Everyone assumes that I would rather stay inside and work than try to interact with others. And it was true: not because I preferred to be alone, but because I had not been given another option.<br /><br />

I am never more alone than when I’m with other people.<br /><br />

Except her.<br /><br />

From the moment I met her, she’d never expected anything from me. I could talk to her for hours on end, and she would never get tired of it. Even all my insults and sarcastic flair, she dealt with it all. And I came to realize, under that glowing sunset on the 26th of August, that she was the one thing I had come to care about the most. She’d shown me a new perspective on living, a world of color and emotion unbeknownst to me before.<br /><br />

And she would never know. I was afraid, scared to lose the only thing that mattered to me anymore. But this is what I have to do.<br /><br />

I cannot keep on being “okay.”<br /><br />

That day, the brown-haired girl in the grass-stained grey skirt changed me forever.<br /><br /></p>

  <hr style="border: 2px dashed #2D383B; margin-right: 175px; margin-left: 175px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 55px; border-radius: 5px;" />

<p>I continue to wait. If I wait long enough, someone will save me. This is a true fact.<br /><br />

The phone rings. I wait a few seconds, then pick it up.<br /><br />

“Hello?”<br /><br />

One - and counting.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I find that I space out a lot these days.<br /><br />

To call it spacing out is a bit of a misunderstanding. Normally, when people ‘space out,’ there’s nothing on their minds. But it seems that I always have something to think about.<br /><br />

In the end, we are powerless to change many of the problems we face. We can feel strongly about them or talk about them, but ultimately those mean nothing. But isn’t it exactly because they are useless that we can enjoy them without fear of consequence?<br /><br />

A story will progress regardless of whether you laugh or you cry. It can start and end whenever you want it to, and it can be morphed to fit whatever lesson you’re trying to tell. Stories are usually not reflective of reality. They exaggerate and they skip around a lot, leaving their audiences confusred and unsatisfied. But like I said earlier, it's not exactly a good use of time to be concerned about these sorts of things.<br /><br />

I’m still learning to develop emotions. To let them take over me at times, and to convey them to others. But no matter what, I am certain that in this moment, I am happy. And that seems to be enough for me.<br /><br />

“I love you.”<br /><br />

It’s slightly awkward knowing that no one can hear it. But still, it feels like the right thing to say.<br /><br />

I am no longer afraid.<br /><br />

After all, there is absolutely nothing I would rather have on my mind than the girl whose head now rests on my shoulder, fast asleep.<br /><br /></p>
