		<h1>Pivot Points, Part 1</h1>
		<h3>4:33 AM</h3>
		<p>Every Saturday I stay up until 4 or 5 in the morning. This one is no exception. The next day I show up late to church, because, well, let’s face it, I just can’t get up in the morning. I guess that part is obvious. The slightly more puzzling part of this narrative is how I always find myself here. I don’t exactly remember much of it the next day, which means that things will probably be back to normal tomorrow. Whatever “normal” is, anyways. So I suppose this is a good time to jot down my thoughts so Sunday Sam can at least understand, if not empathize.<br /><br />

I’ve been working full-time for almost 8 months now. It feels a little strange to type that out, since it doesn’t seem like it’s been that long. I know, I know, some of you reading this are rolling your eyes, thinking “try 8 years, you greenie” or something like that. My apologies that we all have to work for so long. Not exactly the main point here, though, so I’ll move on. I have had the rare fortune of being able to work for a startup that requires all employees to come into the office 5 days a week, so needless to say I am a bit tired. Perhaps that’s the reason I stay up this late on Saturdays, to preserve whatever little bit of the weekend I can. To be honest, sometimes it’s just because I’m playing video games with some old friends for many hours. Today it happens to be the former.<br /><br />

I wouldn’t say that I’m miserable, although I have been thinking about what exactly it is that I am. Tired, yes. Discouraged, maybe a little bit. Maybe “stuck” is the best description for it. Now that I’ve graduated college, I feel like young me has expected me to have doors wide open in every direction, able to succeed in whatever field I can imagine. Unfortunately, little guy, I didn’t make it. I spent the past few years doing fun things and getting lost, and I managed to find a way to make a living for myself now, although it requires me to spend 45 hours a week in a dinky open floor plan office. I can’t take the long and lavish vacations that we’d imagined, and I’m not in a position to open an exciting new business or begin producing music full-time. In some way, I’ve failed you. But I also need you to understand what is realistic.<br /><br />

I guess that’s what this is all about. Reality. Reality for me, at least as of right now, consists of doing work that was at its peak interestingness about 7 months ago for the majority of my time, and finding that thoughts and concerns regarding my tasks bleed into the remainder of it. It’s not something that appeals to me, nor is it something that I’m particularly proud of. Somehow, I feel that not only do I not have the time to do the things I want to do, I don’t even have the time to think the way I want to think. Want to head down to LA this week and see some friends? Don’t even bother considering it. Want to take a break and focus on developing your skills and spending time exploring the city? Bold move to cut off your only source of income. In some way, I feel like I as a person have changed to fit the decision-making process required of a full-time in-person employee. It doesn’t help that there are numerous other aspects of the company that I have issues with, but that’s a conversation we can probably have in-person over coffee. There’s some other work-related stuff that I’m thinking about, but it’s a bit much to include in detail here. All you need to know is that I don’t feel super encouraged about exploring. I feel like I do not want to find out what I am capable and not capable of achieving in this career.<br /><br />
I guess I also just feel a little lost. I don’t exactly know where “home” is. I moved out for college a few years ago and have never went back to live with my parents for an extended period of time, so when I go back to visit, it sort of just feels like I’m stopping by my hometown before going back to my actual home, which I guess is now San Francisco? I don’t exactly feel very at home here, though. After 8 months, I have not much connecting me to this city than my job and my apartment. Friends have been hard to come by, and it’s been exceedingly difficult for me to get over my social anxiety when trying to make plans with anyone I’ve met. I feel like if I got a job in Seattle or New York and ended up moving there, I’d have no reason to ever come back here. It all feels so… transient.<br /><br />

Of course, I’ve been treating this like it was transient the whole time. I don’t exactly have much of a routine outside of work, I haven’t made much effort to plant myself into the city and explore and make any close friends, and I’ve been saving as much as I can, which involves not having a car and not going out too much. All of this has led to a less-than-stellar experience for me. Now, I’m not saying that I hate it here. SF isn’t too bad of a place to stay. But it’s more that I have never really considered this place my home. I moved here for work, and I suppose if the work was located somewhere else, then I would no longer be here. Which begs the question, where exactly is my home? If I just move around all the time, if I have a reason for being in any given city, is it really my choice? Was it ever my choice to begin with? I guess you don’t pick your hometown, either.<br /><br />

That’s mostly what I’ve been feeling. It seems my old fears have caught up to me, unfortunately. My fear of failure, of reaching out, of committing to anything, of being let down or rejected, they’re all back to haunt me. Not as if they ever left. But for a long time, up until I came to this city, they weren’t on my mind very often. Now, everything is back. In addition, I now have to think about financial stability, career movement, long term plans, and a bunch of other new adult stuff. There’s just so much. If only I had the time to think about it all. I can’t even fit it all here. Maybe I have to start writing more again. I don’t know. Too much.<br /><br />

All I know is that I should probably do something.</p>
